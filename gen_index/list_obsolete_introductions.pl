# Obsolete Introductions

This site currently contains $n language-specific introduction pages. They are
probably obsolete and will be removed because they probably contain descriptions
of individual treebanks (rather than languages). In the future, such information
will be copied automatically from the README files in the treebank repositories,
and it will be displayed per treebank, not per language. If you currently have
more information here than in your README file, please copy it to the README
file.
