<p>This is an overview based on the works cited in the README bibliography. Please note that this is a work in progress. A detailed description of each stage of Egyptian is planned to be published.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Egyptian comprises two main stages, Earlier Egyptian, which includes Old Egyptian and Middle Egyptian, and Later Egyptian, which includes Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic (for the latter see the Language Page for <a href="https://universaldependencies.org/cop/index.html">Coptic</a> in UD). Earlier Egyptian is characterized by a synthetic syntax and Later Egyptian by an analytic syntax. In general, hieroglyphic and hieratic script were used for Old Egyptian, Middle Egyptian and Late Egyptian, while Demotic was written in demotic. In these scripts no blanks were used between words.</p>

<h2 id="tokenization-and-word-segmentation">Tokenization and Word Segmentation</h2>

<p>Egyptian texts are annotated with transcription characters. The Egyptian-UJaen treebank uses the Tübingen transcription system (see README). Classifiers are not annotated in the transcription of Egyptian texts because they have no phonetic value or because they repeat sounds expressed in the word, as phonetic classifiers do.</p>

<p>Words are separated by a blank in the transcription of Egyptian texts. A dot is used to separate the ending of a word from its stem, cf: <em>nb.t</em> “mistress” and <em>nb</em> “lord”.
Suffix pronouns are attached to the word they follow by means of a double oblique hyphen, for example: <em>nb.t ⸗f</em> “his mistress”.</p>

<p>Compounds and fixed multiword expressions are connected by a hyphen, for example titles such as <em>ẖri҆-ḥꜣb.t</em> “lector priest” and complex prepositions, for example <em>m-ḫt</em> “behind”. A hyphen is also used to separate the man-impersonal noun <em>ti҆ / tw</em> from a verb form, for example: <em>pr-tw</em> “one shall go”.</p>

<p>Brackets () enclose the omission of an element in the text, while square brackets [] enclose a restored text. Curly brackets {} enclose typographical errors in the text, while the angle brackets &lt;&gt; enclose an emendation.</p>

<h2 id="morphology">Morphology</h2>

<h3 id="tags-and-features">Tags and Features</h3>

<p>The 17 <a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/index.html">Universal POS</a> categories are found in Egyptian.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Adjective (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/ADJ.html">ADJ</a>):
    <ul>
      <li>Old Egyptian and Middle Egyptian: There were a few primary adjectives, for example <em>nb</em> “every”, “all”. Most of them were deverbal adjectives such as <em>nfr</em> “good” and nisba adjectives such as <em>n.i҆</em> “belonging to”, derived from the preposition <em>n</em> “for”. In attributive use, adjectives usually agreed in gender and number with the noun they follow.</li>
      <li>Late Egyptian: Primary adjectives increased, while nisba adjectives were less productive than in earlier stages. Late Egyptian adjectives were usually derived from verbs. In attributive use they no longer agreed with their antecedents.</li>
      <li>Demotic: The number of adjectives was smaller than in earlier stages of Egyptian. They were often replaced by a genitive construction. Demotic adjectives usually had the same gender as the noun they followed. Agreement in number of nouns and adjectives was rare.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Adverb (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/ADV.html">ADV</a>):
    <ul>
      <li>Old Egyptian, Middle Egyptian and Late Egyptian: The use of adverbs such as <em>i҆m</em> “there” was rare. Instead, adpositions (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/ADP.html">ADP</a>s) were usually used, consisting of a preposition and a noun phrase. Adverbs generally occurred at the end of a sentence.</li>
      <li>Demotic: The use of adverbs was more common than in earlier stages of Egyptian. Demotic adverbs fell into three general categories: quality, place and time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Interjection (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/INTJ.html">INTJ</a>):
    <ul>
      <li>All stages of Egyptian: The number of interjections was small in Egyptian texts. The most used interjections in Earlier Egyptian were <em>i҆</em> and <em>hꜣ</em>, which usually accompanied the vocative. In Demotic, <em>i҆</em> was also used to introduce the vocative. In Late Egyptian, the interjection <em>i҆ꜣ</em> had the meaning “truly”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Noun (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/NOUN.html">NOUN</a>):
    <ul>
      <li>Old Egyptian and Middle Egyptian: Nouns had no cases. There were two genders, masculine and feminine. The ending <em>t</em> was used not only to mark the feminine gender but also to form the neuter gender, especially in participles and relative forms, for example <em>nfr.t</em> “that which is good” i.e. “(the) good”. In addition, there were three numbers, singular, plural, and dual.</li>
      <li>Late Egyptian: As in Earlier Egyptian, the noun had two genders, masculine and feminine and the ending <em>t</em> was used to mark the feminine gender. Contrary to Earlier Egyptian, the neuter gender was expressed with the masculine form. The noun had only two numbers, singular and plural. The dual forms were rare and just like the plural.</li>
      <li>Demotic: As in earlier stages of Egyptian, the noun had two genders, masculine and feminine. Although the ending <em>t</em> was usually used in feminine nouns, it was only a graphic convention for it was not pronounced. The neuter gender was usually expressed with the feminine form. The noun had only two numbers, singular and plural.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Proper Noun (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/PROPN.html">PROPN</a>):
    <ul>
      <li>All stages of Egyptian: Names of deities, kings and place names are annotated as <a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/PROPN.html">PROPN</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Verb (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/VERB.html">VERB</a>):
    <ul>
      <li>Old Egyptian and Middle Egyptian: There were two verb conjugations, the “suffix pronoun conjugation” (SPC) and the “Old Semitic suffix conjugation” (OSSC). The SPC needed a noun or a suffix pronoun as a subject in a similar way as non-pro-drop languages, such as English. Most of the exceptions to this rule were due to phonographic reasons. The OSSC consisted of personal endings added to the verb stem similar to the verbs of pro-drop languages, such as Spanish.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The SPC is based on a system of tenses: the past I <em>śč̣m ⸗f</em> (Past-1), the past II <em>śč̣m.n ⸗f</em> (Past-2), the present <em>śč̣m ⸗f</em> (Pres), the future <em>śč̣m ⸗f</em> (Fut), the bireferent future <em>śč̣m.t ⸗f</em> (Bi-Fut) and the contingent tenses <em>śč̣m.i҆n ⸗f</em>, <em>śč̣m.ḫr ⸗f</em> and <em>śč̣m.kꜣ ⸗f</em> (Cont). The SPC also has the subjunctive mood <em>śč̣m ⸗f</em> (Sub). The impersonal construction (Man-Imp) corresponding to “one” in English is realized by adding the noun <em>ti҆</em> / <em>tw</em> to the SPC verb form, for example <em>śč̣m.n -ti҆</em>. In addition, there are two passive verb forms in the SPC, the past passive <em>śč̣m.w ⸗f</em> (PastPass) and the future passive <em>śč̣mm ⸗f</em> (FutPass). The past II <em>śč̣m.n ⸗f</em>, the present <em>śč̣m ⸗f</em>, the future <em>śč̣m ⸗f</em> and the passive forms can be used as abstract relative verb forms (Abstrel), i.e. nominal finite verb forms used syntactically as nouns, especially in the emphatic construction, the Egyptian cleft sentence with an adverbial phrase as focus. The SPC also consists of adjective finite verb forms labelled as “relative verb forms” (Relform).</p>

<p>The OSSC complements the SPC tenses. There are syntactic rules for the use of the OSSC in relation to SPC tenses. Thus, the tense, aspect and mood of the OSSC varies according to its syntactic function.</p>

<p>The Early Egyptian verb system has an imperative (Imp) and infinite verb forms, which are the infinitive (Inf) and participles (Part). The infinitive is used as a noun and in two periphrastic constructions consisting of the preposition <em>m</em> / <em>ḥr</em> + infinitive (progressive present) and the preposition <em>r</em> + infinitive (future).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Late Egyptian: The SPC and the OSSC changed. The core tenses of the Late Egyptian SPC are the past I <em>śč̣m ⸗f</em> (Past-1), the prospective <em>śč̣m ⸗f</em> (Pros) and the terminative <em>śč̣m.t ⸗f</em> (Term). Although the past passive <em>śč̣m.w ⸗f</em> (PastPass) is still used, the Egyptian impersonal construction consisting of <em>tw</em> (Man-Imp) tends to replace the passive. Periphrastic constructions became more productive than in earlier stages.
The OSSC or Stative tends to lose its personal endings. It is used in the First Present. The infinitive became the most common verb form in Late Egyptian. It was not only used in the First Present, but also in the Third Future.</li>
  <li>Demotic: The SPC consists of a past <em>śč̣m ⸗f</em>, a present <em>śč̣m ⸗f</em> and a future <em>śč̣m ⸗f</em>. The Egyptian impersonal construction (Man-Imp) and the passive <em>śč̣m.w ⸗f</em> are lost in Demotic. They are replaced by an active construction using the third person plural pronoun <em>⸗w</em>. The OSSC or Stative, which lost most of the endings, indicates the state resulted from an action. As in Late Egyptian, the Infinitive is used in the First Present and in the Third Future.
    <ol>
      <li>Adposition (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/ADP.html">ADP</a>):</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>All stages of Egyptian: Adpositions are usually prepositions because they are used before a noun phrase. Prepositions occasionally show different forms in status pronominalis (Pron.st) and status constructus (Cons.st.) Complex prepositions (CPs) such as <em>m-śꜣ</em> “in the back” i.e. “behind” are considered multiword expressions (MWE) and they are common in Egyptian. On the contrary, the use of postpositions such as the Old Egyptian one <em>i҆ś</em> “like” is rare in Egyptian.
    <ol>
      <li>Auxiliary (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/AUX_.html">AUX</a>):</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Old Egyptian and Middle Egyptian: The verb <em>wnn</em> “exist” is an auxiliary when it is used to express the tense of an adverbial sentence. The particle <em>i҆w</em> is also considered an auxiliary as it is used to express the present perfect in combination with the past II <em>śč̣m.n ⸗f</em>.</li>
  <li>Late Egyptian and Demotic: There are also auxiliary verbs in Late Egyptian and Demotic, for example the Late Egyptian verb <em>ḫpr</em> followed by the infinitive is used to express iterativity and the Demotic verb <em>wꜣḥ ⸗f</em> followed by the infinitive is used to express the perfective aspect.
    <ol>
      <li>Coordinating conjunction (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/CCONJ.html">CCONJ</a>):</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Old Egyptian and Middle Egyptian: Coordinating Conjunctions are exceptional in Earlier Egyptian, for example <em>rʾ-pw</em> “or”. It should be noted that the Old Egyptian particle <em>i҆śč</em> and the preposition <em>ḥr</em> are occasionally used as a coordinating conjunction in Old Egyptian.</li>
  <li>Late Egyptian and Demotic: Coordinating conjunctions are also rare in later stages of Egyptian. The conjunction <em>rʾ-pw</em> “or” became <em>m rʾ-pw</em> in Late Egyptian. Particles are also used as coordinating conjunctions in Late Egyptian, for example <em>ḫr</em>. The Demotic preposition <em>i҆rm</em> is used as a coordinating conjunction meaning “and”.
    <ol>
      <li>Determiner (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/DET.html">DET</a>):</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Old Egyptian and Middle Egyptian: There are four types of demonstrative pro-adjectives (Dem) with three genders, masculine, feminine and neutral. No article is used in Old Egyptian. The definite article is derived from the demonstrative <em>pꜣ</em>, <em>tꜣ</em>, <em>nꜣ</em> and is first attested in Middle Egyptian documentary texts. The first occurrences of the possessive article <em>pꜣy ⸗f</em>, <em>tꜣy ⸗f</em>, <em>nꜣy ⸗f</em> are also found in those texts.</li>
  <li>Late Egyptian: The definite article, the indefinite article and the possessive article are usual in Late Egyptian. Earlier Egyptian demonstrative pro-adjectives are only used in high registers and they are replaced by a new type of demonstratives.</li>
  <li>Demotic: It knows the same determiners as in Late Egyptian, the definite article, the indefinite article, the Late Egyptian type of demonstratives and the possessive article.
    <ol>
      <li>Numeral (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/NUM.html">NUM</a>):</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Old Egyptian and Middle Egyptian: There are ordinal and cardinal numbers. While “1” and “2” are adjectives, the other cardinals are nouns. Ordinal numbers usually follow a noun in attributive use.</li>
  <li>Late Egyptian: The number one precedes the item counted, while the number two follows it. Other cardinals are considered to be nouns as they precede the item counted in a genitive construction. Ordinal numbers are formed with the prefix <em>mḥ</em> before the cardinal number.</li>
  <li>Demotic: As in Late Egyptian, cardinals precede the item counted except the number two. The numbers from 1 to 10 and 20 also have a feminine form. Ordinals consist of <em>mḥ</em> + the cardinal number and they follow the counted item.
    <ol>
      <li>Particle (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/PART.html">PART</a>):</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Old Egyptian, Middle Egyptian, Late Egyptian and Demotic: Particles are common in all stages of Egyptian. A list of particles can be found in Egyptian grammars.
    <ol>
      <li>Pronouns (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/PRON.html">PRON</a>):</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Old Egyptian and Middle Egyptian: There are three types of personal pronouns, the independent pronouns (IndPron), dependent pronouns (DepPron) and Suffixpronouns (SFP).</li>
  <li>Late Egyptian: The three types of Earlier Egyptian personal pronouns are also found in Late Egyptian, although the forms of the independent pronouns are different. In addition, Late Egyptian has a new type of personal pronoun called the proclitic pronoun (ProcPron) used only in the First Present.</li>
  <li>Demotic: The types of Late Egyptian pronouns are also used in Demotic, although usually in a different form.
    <ol>
      <li>Subordinating conjunction (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/SCONJ.html">SCONJ</a>):</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Old Egyptian and Middle Egyptian: <em>n.tt</em> and <em>wn.t</em> are considered to be subordinating conjunctions as they are used to subordinate sentences.</li>
  <li>Late Egyptian and Demotic: The converter <em>i҆w</em> is used as a subordinating conjunction because it circumstantially subordinates a sentence.
    <ol>
      <li>Punctuation (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/PUNCT.html">PUNCT</a>):</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Old Egyptian and Middle Egyptian: The use of a red structuring point (“Gliederungspunkt”) to separate sentences first appears in hieratic texts from the end of the Middle Kingdom (ca. 1700 BC).</li>
  <li>Late Egyptian: The red structuring point is usually used in New Kingdom hieratic texts.
    <ol>
      <li>Symbol (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/SYM.html">SYM</a>):</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Old Egyptian and Middle Egyptian: Some signs were probably used as symbols, for example:
<img src="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/assets/159358649/d9493c5b-3e5d-4020-90a0-043fc4ba1bde" alt="path132" /> (<em>śrḫ</em>) could symbolize the king’s palace or his tomb.
    <ol>
      <li>Other (<a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/X.html">X</a>):</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>All stages of Egyptian: Some words of unclear meaning and grammatical function are annotated with the tag <a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/X.html">X</a>.</li>
</ul>
