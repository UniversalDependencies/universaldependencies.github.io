        <h1 id="guidelines-for-language-specific-documentation">Guidelines for language-specific documentation</h1>

<p>See also <a href="/contributing/editing.html">How to edit</a>, especially the section
<a href="/contributing/editing.html#style-guidelines">Style guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>There should be a set of guidelines and documentation for every <em>language.</em>
All treebanks in that language should follow the same guidelines.
Any treebank-specific documentation (such as the information whether morphological features have been annotated manually or predicted
by a statistical model) should go to the README file in the treebank repository.
(Note that portions of the README files are automatically copied to the UD website, as described in the
<a href="/contributing/repository_files.html#the-readme-file">release checklist</a>.)</p>

<p>All languages should have a one-page summary of annotation solutions to language-specific phenomena
that cannot be specified universally. There is a template for the page (see below).
If a language uses language-specific morphological features or dependency relation subtypes,
these must be documented on separate pages, following a prescribed format (see below).
Some languages also have a full mirror of the universal documentation of all tags, features and relations.
Such a mirror is no longer expected and templates for these pages are not generated.
Nevertheless, it is possible to have them; contributors wishing to write the full mirror must create the pages manually (see remarks below).</p>

<h2 id="the-language-page">The Language Page</h2>

<p>Also called the language hub or index page, this is the minimal documentation that we want to be available for every language.
It should describe important aspects of every level of annotation, such as (these are just a few example questions, see the template for more):</p>

<ul>
  <li>tokenization / word segmentation (are there multi-word tokens? are there exceptional cases where “words with spaces” are permitted?)</li>
  <li>morphology (which features occur with which parts of speech? what values can the features have in this language?)</li>
  <li>syntax (what criteria distinguish core from oblique arguments? what are the rules for copula?)</li>
</ul>

<p>The docs repository has a folder called <a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/tree/pages-source/_template">_template</a>.
It contains a template of the language index page (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">template-index.md</code>) and two example index pages describing Czech
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">template-index-cs-example.md</code>) and Swedish (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">template-index-sv-example.md</code>), respectively.
The resulting pages can be viewed <a href="http://universaldependencies.org/cs/index.html">here (Czech)</a>
and <a href="http://universaldependencies.org/sv/index.html">here (Swedish)</a>.
When a new language is added to UD, its folder in the docs repository is created (the name of the folder is an underscore followed
by the language code, e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_cs</code> for Czech) and the template index is copied to that folder.
The language contributors should fill out the description of the language, delete the instruction comments,
and when they are done, rename the file from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">template-index.md</code> to just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.md</code>.
Finally, they should contact the release team and ask for regeneration of the UD title page so that the link to the documentation
appears there (at present this does not happen automatically).</p>

<p>If desirable, the contributors may create additional files in their language folder and provide links to those files from the index page.
For example, if separate pages describing individual tags / features / relations are available, links to them should be provided
from the beginning of morphology / syntax sections, respectively.
Such pages are required for features and relations that are language-specific and their documentation is not available
in the universal guidelines (see below for details). For other relations, features and UPOS tags, separate pages are
not required, nevertheless it is possible to create them and provide more native examples in the language.
Note however that if there is any peculiarity of the language pertaining to a universally defined label (tag / feature / relation),
it should be preferably mentioned on the universal page of that label, and possibly also in the construction-oriented universal documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Please do not create empty documentation pages!</strong>
If you do not have the time now to provide some meaningful description, postpone the creation
of the file until you have the time to fill it with contents. It is annoying for the user
to click on a link only to find out that the information is not there. Even if you do not create
any link to the empty page, the links may be generated automatically once the file exists in the
repository.</p>

<h2 id="language-specific-features">Language-Specific Features</h2>

<p>All feature values used in UD treebanks must be documented. If they are defined in the current
version of the UD guidelines, they are already documented and you do not need to write any
documentation. Nevertheless, in order to use them in your data, you must register them for your language
<a href="https://quest.ms.mff.cuni.cz/udvalidator/cgi-bin/unidep/langspec/specify_feature.pl">at the validation server</a>;
the registration includes saying which of the documented values can be used with which UPOS tags.</p>

<p>If you decide to provide their language-specific documentation anyway, note that the global
documentation will be ignored by the system, and if there are errors in your page, the given
universal feature will be undocumented and unavailable in your language.
Some other features are not officially part of the UD guidelines (so technically they are in the
language-specific domain), yet they have been used in multiple treebanks and their documentation
is accessible globally. If you are unsure whether a particular feature is in this category, try
registering it at the validation server. If it is not available there, you will know you have
to provide documentation. Any other language-specific feature
must have a documentation page in the folder of the given language (regardless of whether this
feature is or is not documented in another language). Similarly, if a language needs an extra
value of an otherwise universal feature, there must be a language-specific documentation page
of that feature.</p>

<p>Note that in some cases you should change the feature in your data rather than documenting it.
When defining new feature values, make sure that you are <strong>not redefining something that
already has a different label in UD.</strong></p>

<p>A language-specific feature page must be readable by both humans and machines, hence it must
follow a prescribed format. UD validation software will check the page and if it cannot parse
it, it will not consider the feature valid to be used in UD treebanks.</p>

<p>The page is a MarkDown file and uses the extension <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code>. It must be in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feat</code> subfolder of the
language-specific folder in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docs</code> repository. The name of the file normally follows the
name of the feature, including camel-casing. For example, the feature for particle types in
Irish is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PartType</code> and its documentation must be in the file
<a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/blob/pages-source/_ga/feat/PartType.md">_ga/feat/PartType.md</a>.
Layered features have square brackets as part of their name but not as part of the file name.
Instead of the layer label in brackets, a simple hyphen separates the layer label from the
main feature name. Thus the feature for the possessor’s gender is named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gender[psor]</code> but
the corresponding file is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gender-psor.md</code>, as
<a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/blob/pages-source/_cs/feat/Gender-psor.md">in Czech</a>.</p>

<p>To get started, you may want to copy an existing page from another language and edit it.
Each MarkDown file has a header which starts and ends with three dashes. Here is an example;
edit title and shortdef, keep layout and udver intact:</p>

<pre>
---
layout: feature
title: 'PartType'
shortdef: 'particle type'
udver: '2'
---
</pre>

<p>In the body of the page, level 3 headings (they start with three <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> characters) are reserved
for the individual values of the feature. Here is the required format of the heading for value
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Inf</code>:</p>

<pre>
### &lt;a name="Inf"&gt;`Inf`&lt;/a&gt;: infinitive
</pre>

<p>Make sure you have an exact copy of the heading. Then change the two instances of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Inf</code> to
the actual value of your feature, and put a word or phrase expansion of the value after the
colon. In the following lines, describe the value, what it means and how it is used. Do not
forget to add examples – a level 4 heading saying “Examples”, then a bullet list (with an
asterisk as the bullet) with individual examples, highlighting the featured word with the
&lt;b&gt; tag, and followed by an English translation.</p>

<pre>
#### Examples

* _&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; cheannach_ “to buy”
</pre>

<h2 id="language-specific-subtypes-of-dependency-relations">Language-Specific Subtypes of Dependency Relations</h2>

<p>All relations used in UD treebanks must be documented. If they are defined in the current
version of the UD guidelines, they are already documented and no action is needed.
If you decide to provide their language-specific documentation anyway, note that the global
documentation will be ignored by the system, and if there are errors in your page, the given
universal relation will be undocumented and unavailable in your language.
Subtypes are
optional and technically in the language specific domain, although some subtypes are fairly
widely attested and some are even mentioned in the universal part of the guidelines. If the
documentation of a subtype is accessible globally, no action is needed either. Any other
language-specific relation subtype must have a documentation page in the folder of the given
language (regardless of whether this subtype is or is not documented in another language).
In addition, all relation types must be
<a href="https://quest.ms.mff.cuni.cz/udvalidator/cgi-bin/unidep/langspec/specify_deprel.pl">registered at the validation server</a>
before they can be used in a language (go to the registration page, select your language,
click on the relation type and make sure the check box is checked to permit the relation
in the language).
If you are unsure whether a particular subtype is globally documented, try registering it;
if the registration page does not list it as one of the types that “can be permitted”,
you will know you have to provide documentation.</p>

<p>Note that in some cases you should change the relation in your data rather than documenting it.
When defining new subtypes, make sure that you are <strong>not redefining something that
already has a different label in UD (even in other languages).</strong></p>

<p>A language-specific relation page must be readable by both humans and machines, hence it must
follow a prescribed format. UD validation software will check the page and if it cannot parse
it, it will not consider the relation valid to be used in UD treebanks.</p>

<p>The page is a MarkDown file and uses the extension <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code>. It must be in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dep</code> subfolder of the
language-specific folder in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docs</code> repository. The name of the file normally follows the
name of the relation, only the colon must be converted to a hyphen. For example, the documentation
of the French subtype <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">advcl:cleft</code> must be in the file
<a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/blob/pages-source/_fr/dep/advcl-cleft.md">_fr/dep/advcl-cleft.md</a>.</p>

<p>To get started, you may want to copy an existing page from another language and edit it.
Each MarkDown file has a header which starts and ends with three dashes. Here is an example;
edit title and shortdef, keep layout and udver intact:</p>

<pre>
---
layout: relation
title: 'advcl:cleft'
shortdef: 'cleft adverbial clause modifier'
udver: '2'
---
</pre>

<p>Your description of the subtype starts after the header. Do not forget to add examples
(full dependency trees are preferred over just showing the relation the page is about).
Dependency trees are inserted either in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sdparse</code> environment or in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conllu</code>
environment (the latter is more complex but it allows direct inserting of trees from your
treebank). Do not forget to add an English translation of a foreign-language example.</p>

<pre>
~~~ sdparse
Il y a Marie qui danse dans la pièce . \n Marie dances in the room .
nsubj(a,Il)
advmod(a,y)
obj(a,Marie)
advcl:cleft(Marie,danse)
nsubj(danse,qui)
obl(danse,pièce)
case(pièce,dans)
det(pièce,la)
punct(a,.)
~~~
</pre>

<h2 id="language-specific-lists-for-the-validator">Language-Specific Lists for the Validator</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, certain aspects of the language-specific rules are registered in a database that can be used by
the validator (but it serves as documentation at the same time). We have said that features and relation subtypes
must be registered this way (in addition to documenting language-specific features and relations) but there are other
things that must be registered (and it is likely that more will be required in the future).</p>

<p>Extra care must be taken when these lists are modified for languages that have multiple treebanks maintained by
different teams! It is considered improper to make other people’s treebank invalid by disabling a feature value
(relation, auxiliary, anything) that they use, without consulting them first. You may be right that it is an error
to use the feature value for this part of speech, but there should always be a plan how to fix the data. If you
disable a feature, it is your responsibility to check the new validity status not only of your treebank but also
of the other treebanks for the language.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://quest.ms.mff.cuni.cz/udvalidator/cgi-bin/unidep/langspec/specify_feature.pl">Features</a>:
Register allowed combinations of UPOS tags, features and their values in the given language.</li>
  <li><a href="https://quest.ms.mff.cuni.cz/udvalidator/cgi-bin/unidep/langspec/specify_deprel.pl">Dependency relations</a>:
Turn on/off relation subtypes in the given language.</li>
  <li><a href="https://quest.ms.mff.cuni.cz/udvalidator/cgi-bin/unidep/langspec/specify_edeprel.pl">Enhanced dependency relations</a>:
Register and categorize case-marking subtypes of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obl</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nmod</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">advcl</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">acl</code>, and coordination subtypes of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conj</code>
to be used in the enhanced representation.</li>
  <li><a href="https://quest.ms.mff.cuni.cz/udvalidator/cgi-bin/unidep/langspec/specify_auxiliary.pl">Auxiliaries</a>:
Register and document lemmas that can be tagged <a href="">AUX</a> in the given language. The lemma of the copula is also
registered here and must be labeled as copula, otherwise the relation <a href="">cop</a> cannot be used with it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://quest.ms.mff.cuni.cz/udvalidator/cgi-bin/unidep/langspec/specify_token_with_space.pl">Tokens with spaces</a>
if they are exceptionally allowed in the language, must be specified using regular expressions.
This should be always a limited phenomenon, not allowed for all tokens in the language (unless the language is
Vietnamese).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="old-style-documentation">Old-Style Documentation</h2>

<p>If you want a full mirror of the universal documentation of tags, features and relations, you have to create the .md files in your language
folder. Look at other languages (e.g., Czech), follow the same folder structure, copy the files from the other language, edit them and
replace the contents by your language.</p>

<p>If you already have a (full or partial) mirror with UD v1 documentation, make sure to check all changes that need to be done for v2
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nmod</code> → <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obl</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CONJ</code> → <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CCONJ</code>, renaming files, fixing links etc.), then add this line to the MarkDown preamble of each file:</p>

<pre>
udver: '2'
</pre>

<p>This will cause the server to show the green v2 banner instead of the yellow v1 on the top of the page.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>
The old documentation also contained a copy of the label overview table for every language.
It appeared on pages called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pos-index</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feat-index</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dep-index</code>; however, the table itself
was in HTML rather than MarkDown and it was imported from a file that lay outside the language folder.
These HTML files have been removed for all languages where the corresponding part of v1 documentation
did not exist. If you now copy a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pos-index.md</code> file that references the table, without properly
creating the table, it will not work! Worse: your error will kill Jekyll, the fragile website-building software.
If the pages are not regenerated within 15 minutes after you did some dangerous changes,
try to revert the changes. Otherwise, the infrastructure will no longer work for anyone else!
If you want to experiment with includes and other Jekyll code, please install Jekyll locally
and test everything on your machine before you push it to Github!</p>

<p>Good news: You don’t actually need the index tables.
You should provide links to label-specific pages from your language index page.
This can be just a simple list of links, not a sophisticated table
(if people need a more organized view of the labels,
they should read the universal documentation).</p>

<p><strong>ALSO IMPORTANT:</strong>
To keep the repository portable across operating systems, avoid creating files whose base name (without the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> extension)
is <strong><tt>AUX</tt></strong> or <strong><tt>aux</tt></strong>, e.g., <tt>aux.md</tt> is not permitted!
Note that languages with full documentation use an underscore character in the name (<tt>aux_.md</tt>)
and a redirect-from directive in the MarkDown preamble inside the file.</p>
