`Red` Reduplication is a very productive process in Mundurukú. One of is many functions is to signalize, by reduplicating
the syllable with the vowel *e* and loss of the final consonant.

### <a name="Ex">`Ex`</a>: contiguous

The exmaple below has the root *xat* 'food' reduplicated.
#### Examples

* _<b>Awawa i-xa-xet</b>&nbsp;_ “Grandma has fod”








## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
