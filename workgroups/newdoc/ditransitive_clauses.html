          <h1 id="ditransitive-clauses">Ditransitive Clauses</h1>

<p>Some <a href="/u/pos/VERB.html">verbs</a> in some languages allow three core arguments.
Clauses with three core arguments are called <em>ditransitive</em> or <em>trivalent.</em>
They are often associated with verbs of giving and the semantic roles of
actor (the one who gives), theme/patient (the thing that is given) and
recipient/goal (the one who receives the given thing). Ditransitive clauses
may also be used for concepts related to giving, for example teaching
(which can be understood as giving knowledge).</p>

<p>All languages have means to express giving but not all languages have
ditransitive clauses. In some languages, either recipient or the theme must
be coded as an oblique argument, therefore the verb has only two core arguments
and is <em>(mono)transitive</em> or <em>bivalent.</em> And then there are languages like
English, where both options are available:
<em>I gave John a book</em> is ditransitive, while
<em>I gave a book to John</em> is monotransitive.</p>

<p>For more details on the distinction between core and oblique arguments, see
<a href="simple_verbal_clauses.html">Simple Verbal Clauses</a>.</p>

<h2 id="coding-strategies">Coding Strategies</h2>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="english">English</h3>

<p>Some English verbs allow two objects (i.e., two core arguments following
the verb):</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Peter gave Kate a book.</em></li>
  <li><em>Tom teaches me mathematics.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The traditional approach outside UD is to call the first object <em>indirect</em>
and the second object <em>direct;</em> it is often defined in terms of semantic
roles, saying that the recipient is the indirect object. UD avoids referring
to semantic roles and says instead that <a href="/u/dep/iobj.html">indirect object</a>
is a core argument of the verb that is not its subject or direct
<a href="/u/dep/obj.html">object</a>; the (direct) object is then defined as
“the second most core argument of a verb after the subject.”
In the above examples, the recipient <em>(Kate, me)</em> is arguably more core than
the theme <em>(book, mathematics)</em> because the recipient can be promoted in
passivization more readily than the theme (promotion of the theme is not
completely ungrammatical though; some speakers of some dialects of English
accept it):</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Kate was given a book by Peter. (?A book was given Kate by Peter.)</em> <!--
 <span style="color: orange"><b>Nathan:</b> "A book was given Kate"
 sounds unusual or archaic but not completely ungrammatical to me.
 You can find examples on the web of "advice was given him/her",
 for example. Some COCA examples: "how do you feel about John Poindexter
 and the sentence that was given him today?" (1990 spoken),
 "But when the rooms had been shown and the paper was given him to sign,
 Frisch hesitated, clutching the pen." (1990 fiction).
 Not many COCA examples with by-phrases—only found this one from a 2012
 interview with Sarah Palin, who is known for her colorful use of English:
 "And he got a standing ovation at the end of the speech, and that was
 given him by those who paid attention and stayed to the end, if you will,
 and heard what he had to say." No examples in EWT of a passive verb with
 `iobj`, though.</span> --></li>
  <li><em>I am taught mathematics by Tom. (*Mathematics is taught me by Tom.)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The second object can be promoted more smoothly if both the subject and the first object
are recoded as oblique arguments (in the case of <em>to give</em>) or the first object
is removed (in the case of <em>to teach</em>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>A book was given by Peter to Kate.</em></li>
  <li><em>Mathematics is taught by Tom. (*Mathematics is taught by Tom to me.)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, we have identified one property of core objects that works better
with the first object (the recipient) than with the second object (the theme);
thus the UD v2 guidelines actually require that the second object
be labeled <code class="highlighter-rouge">iobj</code>. Yet in the current English data (UD 2.1), it is still
the first object that is labeled <code class="highlighter-rouge">iobj</code>, and the second object is <code class="highlighter-rouge">obj</code>.
This has to be resolved by either modifying the guidelines, or the data
(diverging from what people traditionally understand under indirect object).</p>

<p><span style="color:green"><b>Dan:</b> If we do not accept that the less
accepted passivization of the theme is enough to say that the second object
is inferior to the first one, then we will have to label both objects as <code class="highlighter-rouge">obj</code>.
There is no way of saying that the first object should be <code class="highlighter-rouge">iobj</code> without
resorting to semantic role labeling. Admittedly it would be advantageous for
some downstream tasks to be able to always identify the recipient; however,
it is not a goal of the basic UD representation to resolve such
syntax-semantic clashes. There are several other options how downstream tasks
are helped with these: 1. relation subtypes within basic UD (for example,
we could use <code class="highlighter-rouge">obj:rcpt</code> here); 2. same as 1, but only done in the enhanced
representation, where labels of oblique dependents are extended too, for the
same reason; 3. full-fledged semantic-role labeling, done as a stand-off
extension on top of UD.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><b>Joakim:</b> I don’t think this is specified by the v2 guidelines.
I tried to
<a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-EWT/issues/55#issuecomment-361508801">argue for it on GitHub</a>,
based on syntactic criteria, but people pushed back saying that
it is convenient for NLP applications to have the same relation for the recipient role in both cases.
This needs to be resolved.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:green"><b>Chris</b> had some comments on <code class="highlighter-rouge">iobj</code> at the end
of <a href="http://universaldependencies.org/v2_prelim/core_dependents.html#what-are-core-arguments">this section</a>
of our discussion before UD v2. There are references (LFG, Huddleston and Pullum 2002)
that we may want to consult before making a final judgment; nevertheless, the
summary there still sounds to me like “UD does not do semantic role labeling,
except for cases where it does.”</span></p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="french">French</h3>

<p>In contrast to English, French can form a ditransitive clause only if the
recipient is realized as a pronominal clitic. If it is a full noun phrase,
its coding will be always oblique (which means, in French as in English, that
a preposition will be used):</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Pierre a donné un livre à Isabelle.</em> “Pierre gave a book to Isabelle.”</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-conllu"># text = Pierre a donné un livre à Isabelle.
# text_en = Pierre gave a book to Isabelle.
1	Pierre	Pierre	PROPN	_	Gender=Masc|Number=Sing	3	nsubj	_	Gloss=Pierre

</code></pre>

<p>However, the third argument will be coded as core argument if it is a personal
pronoun, thus forming a ditransitive clause:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Pierre lui a donné un livre.</em> “Pierre gave her a book.”</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-conllu"># text = Pierre lui a donné un livre.

</code></pre>

<p>We have two different constructions depending on whether the recipient is a
pronoun or a noun.</p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="spanish">Spanish</h3>

<p>The behavior of Spanish core arguments is somewhat similar to English but there
are differences. Like in English, it is typical for a core argument to be
a bare nominal without preposition. However, prepositions are not completely
excluded. If the object is <a href="Animacy">animate</a>, it is marked by the preposition <em>a</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Vimos a alguien.</em> “We saw somebody.”</li>
</ul>

<p>The subject’s person and number is cross-referenced by verbal inflection.
Spanish is a pro-drop language, meaning that the subject can be omitted if it
is a personal pronoun.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>(Yo) bebo vino.</em> “I drink wine.”</li>
  <li><em>(Tú) bebes vino.</em> “You drink wine.” (singular)</li>
  <li><em>El hombre bebe vino.</em>  “The man drinks wine.”</li>
  <li><em>(Nosotros) bebemos vino.</em> “We drink wine.”</li>
  <li><em>(Vosotros) bebéis vino.</em> “You drink wine.” (plural)</li>
  <li><em>Los hombres beben vino.</em> “The men drink wine.”</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-conllu"># text = Vimos a alguien.
# text_en = We saw somebody.

5	.	.	PUNCT	_	_	3	punct	_	Gloss=.

</code></pre>

<p>If the arguments are realized as personal pronouns, the subject is in the
nominative form <em>(yo, tú, él, nosotros, vosotros, ellos)</em> and the object is in the accusative
<em>(me, te, lo, nos, os, los).</em> Nouns do not inflect for case in Spanish.</p>

<p>If both core arguments are present and if they are realized as full noun
phrases, the prototypical word order is the same as in English: the subject
precedes the verb and the object follows it. However, if the object is realized
as a pronominal clitic (and if the verb is finite indicative), the object
precedes the verb.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>El hombre lo bebe.</em> “The man drinks it.”</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-conllu"># text = El hombre lo bebe.
# text_en = The man drinks it.
1	El	el	DET	_	Definite=Def|Gender=Masc|Number=Sing|PronType=Art	2	det	_	Gloss=the

5	.	.	PUNCT	_	_	4	punct	_	Gloss=.

</code></pre>

<p>Both coding strategies that are used for core arguments can also appear with
adjuncts. Bare nominal adjuncts are rare, the exception being
temporal adjuncts. In contrast, the preposition <em>a</em> can be used with various
directional and temporal adjuncts.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Él trabaja toda la semana.</em> “He works the whole week.”</li>
  <li><em>Subiremos al tren a las cinco.</em> “We will be boarding the train at five.”</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-conllu"># text = Él trabaja toda la semana.

</code></pre>

<p>Neither <em>toda la semana</em> nor <em>al tren</em> or <em>a las cinco</em> can be promoted via passivization.
Furthermore, they are inanimate, and only animate direct objects take the preposition.
None of the adjuncts can be replaced by an accusative pre-verbal clitic:
<em>*Él la trabaja.</em></p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="czech">Czech</h3>

<p>Classification of verbal arguments in Czech depends on <a href="/u/feat/Case.html">case morphology</a>.
There are certain anomalies of the case system when the argument is a quantified
phrase (with a cardinal number or a pronominal quantifier, the head noun
may have different case than the entire phrase). We exclude quantified phrases
from the following overview.</p>

<p>The coding strategy most typical for Czech core arguments is bare noun phrase
in nominative or accusative.
Some authors claim that core arguments are not marked for case. This is not
true and Czech is one of the counter-examples. The nominative can be considered
unmarked in the vague sense that it is the default case that is used if
there are no external factors requiring another case. However, it is not
unmarked in the morphological sense: many nouns must use suffixes to form
the nominative (and the same holds for the accusative).</p>

<p>The nominative argument is the subject, the
accusative is object.
The subject’s person, number, and sometimes also gender and animacy are
cross-referenced by verbal inflection.
Czech is a pro-drop language, meaning that the subject can be omitted if it is
a personal pronoun.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Snědl jsem jablko.</em> “I ate an apple.” (masculine)</li>
  <li><em>Snědla jsem jablko.</em> “I ate an apple.” (feminine)</li>
  <li><em>Snědl jsi jablko.</em> “You ate an apple.” (masculine singular)</li>
  <li><em>Snědla jsi jablko.</em> “You ate an apple.” (feminine singular)</li>
  <li><em>Chlapec snědl jablko.</em> “The boy ate an apple.”</li>
  <li><em>Snědl jablko.</em> “He ate an apple.”</li>
  <li><em>Snědla jablko.</em> “She ate an apple.”</li>
  <li><em>Snědlo jablko.</em> “It ate an apple.”</li>
  <li><em>Snědli jsme jablko.</em> “We ate an apple.” (masculine animate)</li>
  <li><em>Snědly jsme jablko.</em> “We ate an apple.” (feminine)</li>
  <li><em>Snědli jste jablko.</em> “You ate an apple.” (masculine animate plural)</li>
  <li><em>Snědly jste jablko.</em> “You ate an apple.” (feminine plural)</li>
  <li><em>Snědli jablko.</em> “They ate an apple.” (masculine animate)</li>
  <li><em>Snědly jablko.</em> “They ate an apple.” (feminine or masculine inanimate)</li>
  <li><em>Snědla jablko.</em> “They ate an apple.” (neuter)</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-conllu"># text = Chlapec snědl jablko.
# text_en = The boy ate an apple.
1	Chlapec	chlapec	NOUN	_	Animacy=Anim|Case=Nom|Gender=Masc|Number=Sing|Polarity=Pos	2	nsubj	_	Gloss=boy

4	.	.	PUNCT	_	_	2	punct	_	_

</code></pre>

<p>Czech word order is free and while the SVO order is preferred by default, other
permutations are possible and may be required to distinguish topic and focus.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Chlapec snědl jablko.</em> “The/a boy ate an apple.”</li>
  <li><em>Jablko snědl chlapec.</em> “It was a/the boy who ate the apple.”</li>
  <li><em>Chlapec jablko snědl.</em> “What the boy did to the apple was that he ate it.”</li>
  <li><em>Jablko chlapec snědl.</em> “As for the apple, what the boy did to it was that he ate it.”</li>
  <li><em>Snědl chlapec jablko.</em> “A boy ate an apple.”</li>
  <li><em>Snědl jablko chlapec.</em> “It was a boy who ate an apple.”</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not guaranteed that a bare accusative nominal is a core argument. It can
also be a temporal adjunct, as in:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Pracuje celý týden.</em> “He works the whole week.”</li>
  <li><em>Přichází každou středu.</em> “She comes every Wednesday.”</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-conllu"># text = Pracuje celý týden.
# text_en = He works the whole week.
1	Pracuje	pracovat	VERB	_	Mood=Ind|Number=Sing|Person=3|Polarity=Pos|Tense=Pres|VerbForm=Fin	0	root	_	Gloss=works
2	celý	celý	ADJ	_	Animacy=Inan|Case=Acc|Degree=Pos|Gender=Masc|Number=Sing|Polarity=Pos	3	amod	_	Gloss=whole
3	týden	týden	NOUN	_	Animacy=Inan|Case=Acc|Gender=Masc|Number=Sing|Polarity=Pos	1	obl:tmod	_	Gloss=week|SpaceAfter=No
4	.	.	PUNCT	_	_	1	punct	_	Gloss=.

</code></pre>

<p>The nominal <em>celý týden</em> cannot be promoted to subject via passivization, which
supports the claim that it is not an object; however, this test is not sufficient
because of some transitive verbs that cannot passivize (<em>dostat</em> “to get”, <em>mít</em> “to have”).
Therefore, accusative temporal adjuncts have to be stated as an exception and
the argument/adjunct distinction cannot be avoided in this case.</p>

<p>Many two-argument verbs in Czech specify the second argument as a bare noun
phrase in a case other than accusative (namely in the dative, genitive or
instrumental). Whether these arguments are core
arguments is a point of disagreement among different authors.
The current (UD 2.1) approach in UD for Czech and several similar Indo-European
languages is to analyze them as core; however, it is less easy to find examples
that could qualify as primary transitive verbs, and there are more confusions
with dependents that would be better described as oblique arguments or adjuncts.
Also, the treatment of these arguments by the grammatical rules such as
passivization is different from the treatment that accusatives receive.
Thus it might be better to say that only bare nominative and accusative
arguments are core, while all the rest is oblique.
Consequently, such two-argument clauses are intransitive.</p>

<p>In Basque, like in Czech, nominal case morphology is essential for recognition
of core argument relations. However, instead of nominative-accusative, the
core pair of cases in Basque is ergative-absolutive.
Most two-argument verbs have one argument in the ergative and the other in
the absolutive case (but see below for other possibilities).
The ergative argument is labeled as subject, the absolutive argument is object.
With primary transitive verbs, the ergative argument corresponds to the agent
and the absolutive argument to the patient.</p>

  <li><em>Ekaitzak itsasontzia hondoratu du.</em> “The storm has sunk the ship.”</li>

<p>The single argument of intransitive verbs takes mostly the absolutive
but sometimes the ergative form. It is labeled as subject in both cases.</p>

<p>The third core case is the dative. Arguments in all three core cases are
cross-referenced on finite verbs. Thanks to cross-referencing, the arguments
can be omitted if they are just personal pronouns.</p>

<p>Some two-argument verbs take dative+absolutive, instead of ergative+absolutive:</p>

<p>In the current data (UD 2.1), the dative argument seems to be labeled <code class="highlighter-rouge">iobj</code>
even in dative-absolutive constructions. However, Zúñiga and Fernández (2014)
write that the dative encodes the A function in such constructions; that
would mean that it should be <code class="highlighter-rouge">nsubj</code>.
Some supporting evidence is also provided by causativization, a
<a href="valency_changing_operations.html">valency-changing operation</a> that takes a
transitive clause, adds a third, ergative argument, and switches the original
subject to the dative (unless it already was in dative). The fact that
causativization is available for dative-absolutive clauses supports our
treatment of the dative argument as the subject.</p>

<p>Some two-argument verbs take ergative+dative, instead of ergative+absolutive:</p>

<p>None of the core arguments is cross-referenced by verbal morphology.</p>

<p>Yidiɲ is interesting because some of its grammatical rules target the S and P
arguments (i.e., subjects of intransitive clauses and objects of transitive
clauses) but exclude A arguments (subjects of transitive clauses) (Andrews,
2007). See the discussion of the antipassive in <a href="valency_changing_operations.html">Valency-Changing Operations</a>
for futher details.</p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="tagalog">Tagalog</h3>

<p>The arguments in Tagalog are marked by function words that could be analyzed as either
prepositions, or case-bearing determiners. Although adpositions are often
associated with oblique arguments and adjuncts, we have seen that it is not
a universal rule. Spanish marks an animate direct object with the preposition <em>a</em>;
Slavic and other languages have prepositional objects that, despite not being
considered core in UD, seem to work the same way as other non-accusative
(but prepositionless) arguments; and in Japanese, all
arguments are marked by postpositions, including the subject and the direct
object. On the other hand, if the nominal markers in Tagalog are determiners,
then Tagalog somewhat resembles modern German, where nominal inflection has
been greatly reduced and the varying forms of determiners are often the only
clue about the case of a noun phrase. Categorizing the Tagalog markers as
determiners seems to be more favored in the literature.</p>

<p>The most core-like argument (also called <em>pivot</em>) is marked by the determiner
<em>ang</em>. The other core argument (if any) is marked by the determiner <em>ng</em>
(pronounced <em>nang</em>). A different set of determiners is used with proper nouns.
No determiners are used with personal pronouns, but the pronouns themselves
inflect for case.</p>

<p>There have been disputes about whether the pivot is subject and whether
Tagalog has a subject at all. Andrews (pp. 210–211) distinguishes two
grammatical relations, the a-subject and the p-subject, each having some
properties that are often associated with subjects in the more familiar
languages. He also says that the actor “has subject-like properties regardless
of whether or not it is the pivot.”
Nevertheless, for the purpose of easier and consistent annotation of Universal
Dependencies it seems advantageous to simplify the matter and always reserve
the <a href="">nsubj</a> relation for the <em>ang</em>-phrase (the pivot).</p>

<p>It seems appropriate to mark the determiners and the personal pronouns with
the <a href="">Case</a> feature: the pivot with nominative, and the other core argument
with accusative.</p>

<p>Locative, directional and benefactive arguments are normally coded as oblique.
However, there are additional voices where these arguments become subjects.
One of the reasons why an argument is fronted as the subject is that the
subject is understood as the topic of the sentence. The <em>ang</em> determiner
implies definiteness (while <em>ng</em>-marked arguments can be definite or
indefinite).</p>

<p>The Algonquian (North American) language Plains Cree is similar to Basque in
its cross-referencing of both the subject and the object by verbal inflection.
It is also very dissimilar to Basque due to its almost complete lack of case
marking on the nouns. Yet the marking of the argument on the verbal head is
sufficient to allow for a relatively free word order (unlike English).</p>

<p>Like in many other languages where person and number of an argument is cross-referenced
by the verb, the argument does not need to appear as a separate word if it
would be just a pronoun.</p>

<p>The two verb forms in the two previous examples differ in <a href="">Voice</a>. The first
example is in the direct voice, where the argument higher in a language-specific
obliqueness hierarchy is more agent-like and the other argument is more patient-like.
First person arguments are higher than third person arguments, therefore the
agent is “we” and the patient is “they”.</p>

<p>In the second example, the argument-marking morphemes have not changed but the
verb is in the inverse voice where the argument lower in the hierarchy (“they”)
is the agent and the higher argument (“we”) is the patient.</p>

<p>It is undoubted that the two arguments that are cross-referenced by the verb
are core arguments. It is less clear how to label the two arguments, as Plains
Cree does not seem to have a subject in the Indo-European sense. Nevertheless,
it seems quite natural to postulate that the argument higher in the hierarchy
is more core-like and thus it gets the label <a href="">nsubj</a> in UD; the other core
argument then gets <a href="">obj</a>. Such a distinction can be annotated easily and
consistently. The subject will be more agent-like in the direct voice, and
more patient-like in the inverse voice, which will be somewhat parallel to
the active and passive voices in other languages.</p>

<p>In the following two examples, the verb forms differ because the first verb
cross-references a singular object, the second a plural.</p>

<!-- page 100 section 2.2.2.2 -->

<p>If two third-person arguments are involved, one of them is considered
<em>proximate</em> (more topical, higher in the obliqueness hierarchy) and the other
is considered <em>obviative</em> (less topical, lower in the obliqueness hierarchy).
The obviative noun is marked morphologically by the suffix <em>-a</em>.
Note that Plains Cree distinguishes singular and plural <a href="">Number</a> for
proximate but not for obviative third person arguments.</p>

<p>Current UD data (as of UD 2.1) does not include languages with direct-inverse
voice systems and proximate-obviative division of third-person arguments.
(Though there has been a <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-1719">paper</a>
that discusses possible application of the old UD v1 guidelines to the related
language of Arapaho.)
The guidelines define a special value for the “fourth person”, which could be
used for obviative arguments (see <a href="">Person</a>). This value is inspired by the
<a href="https://unimorph.github.io/doc/unimorph-schema.pdf#page=41">Unimorph</a> project.
However, the Unimorph specification seems to favor using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person=3</code> with an
additional subfeature for proximate and obviative status:
“In some languages, a fourth person category is used to describe an otherwise
third-person referent that is differentiated from other third-person referents
by a switch-reference-like distinction … or, more commonly, by a distinction in
obviation status… For the purposes of morphological distinctions, these fourth
person categories may call for dedicated verbal morphology. While in some
cases their meaning can be captured by third person (3) plus switch-reference
features or features marking pragmatic voice distinctions (such as the
proximate (PRX) and obviative (OBV)), we include a fourth person category with
the feature 4 to allow for identification of a fourth person category when the
semantic distinctions are complicated or not strictly inflectional in nature.”</p>

<p>A possible alternative would be to revoke the “fourth person” and define
a separate feature <code class="highlighter-rouge">Obviation</code> with the values <code class="highlighter-rouge">Prx</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Obv</code>. There are two
places where the feature could be used: as a verbal feature (cross-referencing
the argument) and as a nominal feature (marking the argument). Especially in
nominal inflection it seems preferable to use a new feature rather than assert
that the noun inflects for person (with values <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">4</code> only).</p>

<p>Yet another option would be to include the nominal inflection under <a href="">Case</a>
marking, i.e., a noun with the obviative morpheme would be <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Acc</code> and
the unmarked nouns would be <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Nom</code>. However, such an extension could be
perceived as stretching the usual definition of case too far. The main oddity
would be that it only applies to third-person referents and only if two such
referents compete as arguments of the same verb. If one argument of the verb
is first-person and the other third-person, both will stay in the “nominative”
regardless of their semantic roles. Therefore, defining a new feature,
separate from <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case</code>, is probably a better and less confusing solution.</p>

<p>Even though Plains Cree does not use morphological cases to distinguish agents
from patients, there is a form of nouns that can be classified as the locative
case (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Loc</code>). It clearly marks the noun as oblique and unable to be
cross-referenced by verbal inflection. The other, bare nominal forms, could
then be tagged as nominative (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Nom</code>), or, optionally, left with the <a href="">Case</a>
feature empty.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-relations">Summary of Relations</h2>

<p>The features discussed in this chapter are <a href="">nsubj</a>, <a href="">obj</a>, <a href="">iobj</a> (core arguments) and <a href="">obl</a> resp. <a href="">obl:arg</a> (oblique dependents).</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="">nsubj</a> — nominal subject, typically the most “core-like” argument.</li>
  <li><a href="">obj</a> — nominal object, the second most “core-like” argument. If the third argument shows fewer core properties,
then this is the direct object and the third argument is called indirect object and labeled <code class="highlighter-rouge">iobj</code>.
If both objects are equal in “coreness status”, then both shall be labeled <code class="highlighter-rouge">obj</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="">iobj</a> — nominal indirect object, the least “core-like” of the three arguments (only if it can be shown that it lacks
some core properties that the other object has).</li>
  <li><a href="">obl</a> — nominal oblique argument or adjunct.
If some of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">obl</code> subtypes are used in the language, then the bare <code class="highlighter-rouge">obl</code> denotes the remaining situations not covered by the subtypes.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="">obl:arg</a> — oblique argument (if the data provider decides to distinguish it from adjuncts)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are other optional subtypes of these relations defined elsewhere in
this documentation or in language-specific guidelines. If such subtypes exist,
then quite naturally the label without subtype denotes only the remaining
cases, not covered by subtypes.</p>
