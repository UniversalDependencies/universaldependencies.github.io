        <h1 id="can-determiners-have-children-in-the-tree-structure">Can Determiners Have Children in the Tree Structure?</h1>

<p>This page discusses nodes that are attached to their parents via the <a href="">det</a> relation. When we say <em>determiner</em> in this text, we are referring to the relation and not to the UPOS category <a href="">DET</a>. Of course, there is a strong correlation between the two but it is not absolute. For example, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DET</code> could be promoted when its noun is elided, then its incoming relation would be something else than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">det</code> and the rules discussed here would not apply.</p>

<p>Determiners are generally considered function words in UD. As such, they are typically leaf nodes, that is, they do not have children. However, this rule is not strict and the <a href="/u/overview/syntax.html#the-status-of-function-words">guidelines list some exceptions</a> for various function words including determiners.</p>

<p>For several years, the <a href="/release_checklist.html#validation">UD validator</a> did not enforce this rule for determiners while it was doing so for other function words. The test was finally <a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/tools/commit/1e4debd">implemented in September 2024</a> under the label <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">leaf-det-clf</code>, <a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/tools/commit/c5b8cf5ecff55c27affa8ff0eac737cb799883c8">later split</a> to two tests, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">leaf-det</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">leaf-clf</code>; since this page is about determiners and not about classifiers, we are interested in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">leaf-det</code>. Like other similar tests for function words, it allows determiners to have children if the (universal part of the) relation between the determiner and the child is in a predefined subset:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="">goeswith</a> – Like any other word, determiner may be incorrectly split to multiple tokens in writing, then the pieces must be connected via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goeswith</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="">reparandum</a> – Like any other word in spoken data, determiner may be the correct word after an incorrect fragment has been uttered, then the incorrect fragment must be attached to the determiner via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reparandum</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="">fixed</a> – This relation is used to connect tokens in fixed multiword expression that act as a function word. Multiword determiners are not common but they do occur e.g. in French <em>lire <b>de la</b> documentation</em> “to read documentation”.</li>
  <li><a href="">conj</a> and <a href="">cc</a> – Determiners can be coordinated (e.g. <em><b>each and every</b> member</em>).</li>
  <li><a href="">punct</a> – Punctuation should normally be attached to a content word, but it must be attached to a function word if
    <ul>
      <li>the function word is the only word enclosed in paired punctuation such as brackets;</li>
      <li>or if it is the only way how to avoid non-projectivity;</li>
      <li>or if it separates coordinate function words.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="light-adverbials">Light Adverbials</h2>

<p>The <a href="/u/overview/syntax.html#function-word-modifiers">guidelines also acknowledge</a> that “certain types of function words can take a restricted class of modifiers, mainly light adverbials (including negation).” They explicitly give one example that involves a determiner: <em><b>not every</b> linguist</em>. Ideally the validator should have the list of permitted modifiers (light adverbials) for each language; as such lists are currently not available, the validator has additional deprel-level exceptions, although they potentially open the door for other adverbials that should not be allowed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="">advmod</a> – It is used to attach negative particles such as <em>not</em> in <em>not every linguist</em>.</li>
  <li><a href="">obl</a> – A modifier could be semantically adverbial but syntactically expressed as a nominal rather than an adverb. In that case, it must be attached as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obl</code> and not as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">advmod</code>. This exception was copied from other function words although it is unclear yet whether it is needed with determiners.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="problematic-constructions">Problematic Constructions</h2>

<p>After the validation test was introduced, it identified problems in over 200 UD treebanks. For some of them, their maintainers suggested that the guidelines should be extended to allow additional specific constructions. The full discussion is in <a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/1059">Issue #1059</a>; as it is extremely long and messy, we try to summarize the interesting points here.</p>

<h3 id="compound-determiners">Compound Determiners</h3>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/1059#issuecomment-2413484624">Laura Rituma</a>)</p>

<p>In Latvian, we have several expressions considered as compound pronouns in Latvian traditional grammar which consist of one particle and one pronoun. For example, <em>kaut kāds</em> where <em>kaut</em> is a particle and <em>kāds</em> is a pronoun (this expression roughly means ‘some kind of’). Currently, we annotate the particle as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">discourse</code> which is dependent of pronoun, and pronoun occasionally becomes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">det</code> if the expression describes a noun. This leads to validation error.</p>

<p>The particles in these expressions usually are <em>kaut</em>, <em>diez</em>, <em>diezin</em>, <em>nez</em>, <em>nezin</em>, and they all have very fuzzy, hard to pin down semantics so we feel uncomfortable annotating them as adverbs.</p>

<p>We would like to annotate these expressions as <a href="">compound</a> (instead of <a href="">fixed</a>) because the pronoun is the second element in the phrase and we feel that it is the head of the phrase  because the pronoun inflects together with a noun and bears the most of semantic meaning of the expression.</p>

<p>It seems that the test should not report cases where a determiner has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">compound</code> child. After all, compound is just a signal that two nodes together act almost like one word, but in contrast to fixed, one of them can be considered the head.</p>

<h3 id="determiners-under-determiners-case-under-determiners">Determiners under Determiners, Case under Determiners</h3>

<p>As the guidelines <a href="/u/overview/syntax.html#the-status-of-function-words">say</a>, multiple determiners are always attached directly to the head noun:</p>

<div id="s3c" class="sd-parse">
All/DET these/DET three/NUM books/NOUN .
det(books, All)
det(books, these)
nummod(books, three)
</div>

<p>However, some languages have constructions that look quite different from the English example above.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/1059#issuecomment-2400694043">Daniel Swanson</a>)</p>

<p>In Hebrew (both Ancient and Modern), demonstrative pronouns have their own determiners, as in “the men the these” = “these men”. It is also parallel to how adjectival modification works in Modern Hebrew. Maybe determiners under demonstratives could be allowed in some languages but not the others?</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/1059#issuecomment-2441260051">Petr Kocharov</a> brought up a similar issue in Classical Armenian. Prepositions and articles can be repeated with modifiers, including demonstrative pronominal adjectives, within NP, cf.</p>

<p><em>i kʻarancʻ y ayscʻanē</em>
from stone.ABL.PL from this.ABL.PL
“from these (from) stones”</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">i kʻarancʻ y ayscʻanē
det(kʻarancʻ, ayscʻanē)
case(kʻarancʻ, i)
case(ayscʻanē, i)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="spoken-data">Spoken Data</h3>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/1059#issuecomment-2407036491">Sylvain Kahane</a>)</p>

<p>For spoken data, we need three relations to be added to the validator:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">discourse</code>, which is very common between two determiners in false starts: “a, uh, a gap”, “my, uh, our friend”</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parataxis</code> for cases such as “a, I don’t how to call that, a kiosk, …”: here we have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reparandum</code> link between the two “a”s and we would like to attach the parenthesis to the first “a”. More exactly we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parataxis:parenth</code> in our spoken French treebanks.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dep</code> for false starts such as “the last, the last day”: here “the last” forms a phrase the head of which is missing and we decided to have dep(the, last). I am not against another solution, as long as “the last” is still a phrase.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/1059#issuecomment-2438448236">Laura Rituma</a> added a Latvian example where parataxis may be needed and it is not spoken data. But <a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/1059#issuecomment-2440023939">Joakim Nivre</a> thinks that even here we see two determiners that should be attached as siblings to the head noun.</p>

<h3 id="reduplication-flat">Reduplication (flat)</h3>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/1059#issuecomment-2419904450">Flavio Cecchini</a>)</p>

<ol>
  <li>The already mentioned reduplication, which is treated through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flat:redup</code> in Latin treebanks. One example is <em>quot quot</em> from <em>quot</em>: while the latter means ‘as many as’, the reduplication has a distributive sense as in ‘for each possible one…’ (this expression is sometimes even univerbated). I think to annotate them separately, each depending on the head, is not the right way to deal with them: here we do not have two or more different terms, but really the same one “clonating” itself. On the other hand, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flat</code> is really the closest relation we have to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixed</code>, which would cause no problem, but is not a correct choice (well, in my opinion it is never the correct choice)
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Problem:</strong> horizontal relation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Can we deactivate the validation rule if the child of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">det</code> is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flat</code> relation?</p>

<p>Dan: Why is <a href="">fixed</a> not a good choice? I think it is the right choice here.</p>

<h3 id="relative-clause-modifying-a-referent-hidden-in-a-possessive-determiner">Relative Clause Modifying a Referent Hidden in a Possessive Determiner</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The phrase <em>nostra qui remansissemus caede</em> ‘the murder of us who are left (behind)’, but more literally ‘our who are left murder’, since <em>nostra</em> is the inflected possessive determiner for the 1st person plural. What happens here is that the possessive adds a nominal person, as it were, and this person is another referent beyond the noun <em>caede</em> ‘murder’ in this phrase; as such, the relative can target it (or at least, Cicero pleases himself in doing so). We could not really justify an analysis where we shift the relative under the head noun, since the murder is not one of its arguments.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Problem:</strong> the relative clause dependent of the determiner cannot be traced back to the referent of its head</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Can we deactivate this validation rule if the head element has the feature <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code>, at least for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">acl:relcl</code>?</p>

<h3 id="apposition">Apposition</h3>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/1059#issuecomment-2426979819">Jack Rueter</a>)</p>

<p>A possessive determiner may have an appositional child: <em>His, Fred’s, friends come from all over.</em> This is in fact not a problem in English where personal possessives are pronouns rather than determiners (and they are attached as [nmod:poss]) but in other languages it is a problem. For example in Erzya:</p>

<p><em>Конат-конат сонзэ (Степан Иваныч) ладсо сырелгадсть…</em> / <em>Konat-konat sonzè (Stepan Ivanyč) ladso syrelgadstʹ…</em> “such-such.PL his/her (Stepan Ivanych) way.INE become.older.3PL”</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Конат-конат сонзэ ( Степан Иваныч ) ладсо сырелгадсть
obl(сырелгадсть, ладсо)
det(ладсо, сонзэ)
appos(сонзэ, Степан)
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/1059#issuecomment-2437494587">Koichi Yasuoka</a> provided a Chinese example of apposition.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-coordination-syntactic-flat">Semantic Coordination, Syntactic Flat?</h3>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/1059#issuecomment-2433801928">Koichi Yasuoka</a>)</p>

<p>In Classical Chinese 彼此兵 “those and these soldiers” is invalidated by this rule. The English translation has coordinate determiners but there is no coordinating conjunction in the original and 彼此 “that this” are connected via <a href="">flat</a>. Then “that” is attached as <a href="">det</a> to “soldier”.</p>

<h3 id="nominal-possessive-modifier-of-a-determiner">Nominal Possessive Modifier of a Determiner</h3>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/1059#issuecomment-2424872098">Janine Siewert</a>)</p>

<p>Low Saxon: It is explained in Section 5.1 here: <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.1388.pdf">https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.1388.pdf</a>
The gloss and translation of the sentence can be found in Section 4.3.</p>

<p><em>Ik sto in der Gemoene iarem Denste</em> “I stand in the service of the parish.” (lit. “I stand in the.DAT parish.DAT her.DAT service.DAT”)</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Ik sto in der Gemoene iarem Denste
nsubj(sto, Ik)
obl(sto, Denste)
case(Denste, in)
det(Denste, iarem)
nmod:poss(iarem, Gemoene)
det(Gemoene, der)
</code></pre>

<p>Attaching the possessor in dative case to the possessee instead of the determiner does not represent the way this construction works because 1) the dative possessor cannot be attached to the possessee without the determiner and 2) the possessee can be dropped while the determiner cannot. E.g., in the example in my paper, “In der Gemoene iarem.” (literally “in the parish hers”) is a valid answer to a specification question in whose service the person stands. (A note to German speakers: Masculine and neuter nouns show that this is indeed a dative, not a genitive.)
The alternative to change the determiners’ tags to PRON in Low Saxon would go against UD’s own definition of determiners.</p>

<p>DZ: Is <em>iarem</em> coreferential with <em>der Gemoene</em>? Attaching <em>Gemoene</em> as <a href="">nmod:poss</a> of <em>iarem</em> is odd because it suggests that <em>Gemoene</em> is the possessor of her, not of the service.
The cited paper also says: “Among the UD languages, we have found comparable constructions in Afrikaans, Frisian Dutch, and Norwegian, but the annotation has been inconsistent across these languages.” The annotation indeed should be made consistent, but maybe one of those languages uses an analysis that works well under the UD guidelines?</p>

<h3 id="adverbial-clauses">Adverbial Clauses</h3>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/1059#issue-2574038827">Nathan Schneider</a>)</p>

<p>In English, <em>such</em> is a demonstrative determiner and it may license an <a href="">advcl</a>, as in <a href="https://universal.grew.fr/?custom=66f9b53a31605">these results</a>. The guidelines on <a href="/u/overview/specific-syntax.html#sufficiency-and-excess">sufficiency and excess</a> for <em>so</em> and similar say the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">advcl</code> should attach to the adjective or adverb, not the noun in a case like <em>sufficient flour</em>. Then in <em>such a high price <strong>that nobody could afford it</strong></em>, we may want to attach the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">advcl</code> dependent to <em>such</em>.</p>

<p>Ideally, the validator should allow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">advcl</code> specifically in English and only if the head is <em>such</em>. If there are similar constructions in other languages, they should be also registered specifically for those languages and not en bloc for the whole UD.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/1059#issuecomment-2452025700">Joakim Nivre</a>) You have the choice of treating <em>such</em> as <a href="">amod</a>, in which case it is unproblematic to attach an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">advcl</code> to it. If you treat <em>such</em> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">det</code>, you instead have to attach the clause to its head (that is, to the whole phrase). This is similar to how we treat some comparative constructions. (Dan Zeman) If <em>such</em> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amod</code>, then it should probably also have the <a href="">ADJ</a> UPOS tag. Although it looks like the current validator will not complain if it sees a <a href="">DET</a> attached as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amod</code> (it definitely does complain if it sees an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ADJ</code> attached as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">det</code>).</p>
