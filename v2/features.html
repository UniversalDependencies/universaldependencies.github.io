          <h1 id="features-in-ud-v2">Features in UD v2</h1>

<p>We propose for v2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rename <code class="highlighter-rouge">Negative</code> to <a href="">u-feat/Polarity</a> and rename individual values of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Aspect</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Definite</code>.</li>
  <li>Remove <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tense=Nar</code> (but keep the other values of <a href="">u-feat/Tense</a>).</li>
  <li>For a number of existing features, add new values that may be or have already been needed in some languages.</li>
  <li>Add four new features to the universal set of features: evidentiality, politeness, abbreviation and foreign.</li>
  <li>A number of other potential changes is suggested for general discussion but not really proposed yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>The proposals in this chapter are based on</p>

<ol>
  <li>experience with applying the v1 features (see also the <a href="http://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Afeatures">issue tracker</a>)</li>
  <li>survey of language-specific features and values used in current UD treebanks (especially those that are also documented)</li>
  <li>draft proposal from the <a href="http://www.unimorph.org/" target="_blank">UniMorph project</a>, which has similar goals as UD features (<a href="http://www.unimorph.org/doc/Sylak-Glassman_2016_-_UniMorph_Schema_User_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">Sylak-Glassman 2016</a>; see below for a comparison of UniMorph and UD features)</li>
</ol>

<p>Another reference that could contribute to the universal features is the <a href="http://linguistics-ontology.org/gold/2010">GOLD ontology</a>; see also <a href="http://linguistics-ontology.org/">the general project page</a>. In particular, items in the ontology under Morphosemantic property and Morphosyntactic property roughly correspond to our features.</p>

<h2 id="renaming-existing-features-andor-values">Renaming existing features and/or values</h2>

<p>See the <a href="http://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/219">issue 219</a> for related discussion.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/Aspect</a>: values <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pro</code> (prospective, used in Basque) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Prog</code> (progressive, used in Basque, Turkish and Chinese) are highly confusing.
I propose to change the prospective value to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Aspect=Prosp</code>, following the label used in UniMorph.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Negative</code>: current proposal – rename the feature to <a href="">u-feat/Polarity</a> (and keep values <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pos</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Neg</code>).
Another option would be to keep the name but use only one value <code class="highlighter-rouge">Yes</code> because positive polarity is rarely marked morphologically.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Negative=Pos</code> looks weird and it probably just marks words that can take the negative morpheme but do not have it in the given form.
Nevertheless, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Negative=Pos</code> is currently used in 13 treebanks so we probably want to keep it but rename the feature to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Polarity</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/VerbForm</a>: rename <code class="highlighter-rouge">Trans</code> (transgressive) to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Conv</code> (converb).
Transgressive is a term that comes from Slavic languages and is alien to e.g. Turkish or Hindi where functionally similar forms exist.
It turns out that even within Slavic linguistics, the term transgressive is not widely used (the Slavic languages naturally have their
native terms; the translation <em>transgressive</em>, of Latin-German-English etymology, is almost unknown outside Czech, Slovak and Sorbian).
English literature on Slavic languages sometimes uses the term <em>gerund</em> but it is absolutely confusing and unsuitable because it is
similar neither in form nor in function to the form we mark <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Ger</code> in English and Spanish (and BTW these are also quite different
from each other, but at least Spanish has the term <em>gerundio</em> as its own, not only as English translation).
More neutral terms are adverbial participle or <em>converb</em> (Haspelmath, 1995), so I propose to relabel these forms <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Conv</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/Definite</a>: rename <code class="highlighter-rouge">Red</code> (reduced) to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cons</code> (construct state); see the
<a href="http://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/135">issue 135</a> for related discussion.</li>
  <li>TO DISCUSS: What is <code class="highlighter-rouge">NumType=Pers</code> in Irish? (Defined but not used.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="addingremoving-values-tofrom-existing-features">Adding/removing values to/from existing features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/Animacy</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Animacy=Hum</code> (human).
We currently have three values of animacy, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Anim</code> (animate), <code class="highlighter-rouge">Inan</code> (inanimate) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Nhum</code> (non-human).
The last one is used so far only in Polish. As a side effect, it restricts the meaning of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Anim</code> to human (also
called personal) nouns. While it is not unusual that feature meaning slightly shifts across languages (e.g. plural
means “more than one” in some languages and “more than two” in others), it will be more intuitive to divide the
Polish nouns into <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hum</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Nhum</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Inan</code>. More importantly, there are languages (e.g. Yuwan, a Ryukyuan language)
that only distinguish human vs. non-human, and the latter includes inanimates.
On the other hand, languages like Czech will keep their animate vs. inanimate two-way distinction.
The precise meaning will thus remain
language-specific, but more appropriate labels will now be available.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/Case</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Equ</code> (equative, means “X-like”, “similar to X”, “same as X”). It is already used in UD Turkish and it is also proposed in UniMorph.</li>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Cmp</code> (comparative, means “than X”). It occurs in Dravidian and Northeast-Caucasian languages; it is proposed in UniMorph.</li>
      <li>TO DISCUSS: Chinese “cases” Advb, Comp, Rel.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/Degree</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Degree=Equ</code> (equative, means “as X as”; note that it marks the adjective and it is distinct from the equative case, which marks
the standard of comparison). One of the examples in UniMorph is Estonian <em><b>pikkune</b> (pikkus+ne)</em> “as tall as”.
UD Estonian contains 6 occurrences of <em>pikkune</em> but it does not define equative as a language-specific feature; it uses simply <code class="highlighter-rouge">Degree=Pos</code> here.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/Definite</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Definite=Spec</code> (specific indefinite, e.g. “a certain stick”). Occurs e.g. in Lakota, proposed in UniMorph. In languages where it is used
the value <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ind</code> is interpreted as non-specific indefinite, i.e. “any (one) stick”.</li>
      <li>TO DISCUSS: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Definite=2</code> in Hungarian.
Description: definiteness-like agreement of verbs with a second person object in <a href="hu-feat/Definite">Hungarian</a>.
Hungarian verbs have to be conjugated in harmony with the definiteness of the object, making a difference between
a definite object (<em>nézem a filmet</em> “I am watching the film”), an indefinite object (<em>nézek egy filmet</em> “I am
watching a film”) and a second person object (<em>nézlek téged</em> “I am watching you”). So <code class="highlighter-rouge">Definite=2</code> is actually not
about definiteness proper, maybe it should be <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person[obj]</code>. Perhaps we should leave this value specific to
Hungarian.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/Number</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number=Count</code> from Bulgarian (and Macedonian). It is known variously as “counting form”, “count plural” or “quantitative plural” (Sussex and Cubberley 2006, p. 324).
It is a special plural form of nouns if they occur after numerals: <em>tri stola</em> “three chairs” vs. <em>stolove</em> “chairs”.
(The form originates in the Proto-Slavic dual but it should not be marked <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number=Dual</code> because 1. the dual vanished from Bulgarian and 2. the form is no longer semantically tied to the number two.)</li>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number=Tri</code> (trial). Occurs in pronouns of several Austronesian languages; proposed in UniMorph.</li>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number=Pauc</code> (paucal, means “a few”). Proposed in UniMorph.</li>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number=Grpa</code> (greater paucal, means “more than several but not many”). Occurs in Sursurunga, an Austronesian language. Proposed in UniMorph.</li>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number=Grpl</code> (greater plural, means “many, all possible”; precise semantics varies across languages). Proposed in UniMorph.</li>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number=Inv</code> (inverse number, i.e. non-default for that particular noun). Occurs e.g. in Kiowa. Proposed in UniMorph.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/VerbForm</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Gdv</code> (gerundive, not gerund) in Latin and Ancient Greek.</li>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Vnoun</code> for verbal nouns other than infinitives (also called <em>masdars</em> by some authors, e.g. Haspelmath, 1995).
In UD v1 we were advising to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Ger</code> for them, using the English gerunds as model. However, the term <em>gerund</em>
is rather confusing: in Spanish (and other Romance languages?) it denotes the present participle and should be thus labeled
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Tense=Pres|VerbForm=Part</code>; some Slavists use it to denote converbs (adverbial participles), which we now propose to label
<code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Conv</code> (previously <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Trans</code>).</li>
      <li>Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Ger</code> is discouraged and alternatives should be considered first. However, the feature is still available in UDv2
and can be used if the alternatives do not seem acceptable. The feature may be removed in future versions but comprehensive
investigation has to be done first.
        <ul>
          <li>Observations from UD 1.4:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Ger</code> occurs in most of the Romance languages (Catalan, Spanish, Galician, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian) and Latin.
I assume that in all these languages the form and function is similar to the Spanish <em>gerundio</em>, hence it should be replaced
by <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Part|Tense=Pres</code> (but I am unsure whether it can be extended to Latin).
It occurs in one Slavic language (Polish) and it should be replaced by <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Vnoun</code> there. The same feature could be used
in all Slavic languages but verbal nouns are currently not distinguished there.
It occurs in two Germanic languages (English, Danish) and I do not know whether it can be relabeled as verbal noun there.
Finally, it also occurs in Irish, Sanskrit, Tamil, Kazakh and Turkish (I am not able to judge what should happen there if
<code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Ger</code> is not available).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>TO DISCUSS: <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=PartFut|PartPast|PartPres</code> in Hungarian. These should probably be two features, <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Part</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tense=Fut</code>, as in other UD languages.</li>
      <li>TO DISCUSS: <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Cop</code> in Irish. There is no documentation so we will need some input from Teresa if we want to do anything with it.</li>
      <li>TO DISCUSS: <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Stem</code> currently only one occurrence in Swedish.
Verb stems also occur regularly in Hindi but they have the function of adverbial participles (converbs, transgressives) there, so <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Conv</code> should be used for them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/Mood</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Prp</code> (purposive, means “in order to”). Occurs in Amazonian languages; proposed in UniMorph.</li>
      <li>TO DISCUSS: Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Int</code> (intentive, indicates that the speaker strongly intents for the action of the verb to be realized). Occurs in Tonkawa; proposed in UniMorph.</li>
      <li>TO DISCUSS: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Int</code> in Irish (what does it mean? Interrogative?)</li>
      <li>TO DISCUSS: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Inter</code> in Chinese (what does it mean?)</li>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Adm</code> (admirative; expresses surprise, irony or doubt). Occurs in Albanian, other Balkan languages, and in Caddo (Native American from Oklahoma). Proposed in UniMorph.</li>
      <li>TO DISCUSS: Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Per</code> (permissive; means “may, is permitted”).</li>
      <li>TO DISCUSS: Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Ded</code> (deductive, inferential, speculative; means “[I believe that it] ought to, must be”).</li>
      <li>TO DISCUSS: Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Sim</code> (simulative, means “as if”).</li>
      <li>Do not add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Abil</code>, which is currently used in UD Turkish. The Turkish data should use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Pot</code> (potential) instead.</li>
      <li>Do not add sequences of mood markings, which are currently used in Turkish and may be needed in other agglutinating languages. Leave them language-specific.
[tr] AbilCnd, AbilDes, AbilGen, AbilGenNec, AbilImp, AbilNec, AbilPrs (all of these should start with Pot instead of Abil), GenNec.</li>
      <li>TO DISCUSS: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Prs</code> (persuasive) in Turkish. Reportedly similar in meaning to imperative, but tries to persuade the addressee rather than issuing a direct command.
But it could be also analyzed as a politeness distinction (comment by John Sylak-Glassman), perhaps <code class="highlighter-rouge">Polite=Elev</code> (see below).
Hence we should be careful and at least discuss this more with Çağrı before we possibly add the value.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/Tense</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tense=Aor</code> (aorist), despite its current usage in Ancient Greek and Turkish.
It is a confusing term with different meanings in grammars of different languages.
In Slavic languages we use normal <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tense=Past</code> to denote aorist.
In Turkish it is the unmarked non-past form.</li>
      <li>Do not add sequences of tense markings, which are currently used in Turkish and may be needed in other agglutinating languages. Leave them language-specific.
[tr] AorPast, FutPast.</li>
      <li>Remove <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tense=Nar</code>. It has not been used anywhere yet. In Turkish, for which it was intended, the renarrative past is encoded as
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Evidentiality=Nfh|Tense=Past</code>. And we are proposing to adopt evidentiality as a new universal feature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/Aspect</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Aspect=Iter</code> (iterative). It is already used in Hungarian UD, although it is called frequentative there
(<code class="highlighter-rouge">Aspect=Freq</code>). It is called <em>iterative</em> in UniMorph and I also think the term iterative is more common cross-linguistically,
although I have not checked Hungarian grammar. (Note: Iteratives also exist in Czech with this name and meaning but they can
be formed only from imperfective verbs and they are usually not classified as a separate aspect; they are just <code class="highlighter-rouge">Aspect=Imp</code>.)
Hungarian example: <em>üt</em> “hit”, <em><b>ütöget</b></em> “hit several times”.</li>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Aspect=Hab</code> (habitual). Proposed in UniMorph and in Turkish documentation (although not used in current Turkish data).
It is the most accurate description for the simple present in English, and it said to be useful for a variety of other languages.</li>
      <li>TO DISCUSS: Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Aspect=Rapid</code>? Used in UD Turkish, suffix <em>-iver,</em> Kornfilt (1995, p.361) calls this rapid or sudden aspect.
John: In another grammar, Göksel and Kerslake (2005, p.79), the -iver morpheme seems to have a considerably wider range of meaning
than simply <code class="highlighter-rouge">rapid' or </code>sudden.’ In fact, it seemed to me to imply probability that some event would occur.
Native Turkish speakers should deffinitely weigh in on this.</li>
      <li>TO DISCUSS: Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Aspect=Dur</code>? Proposed in Turkish documentation but in the data it appears only as the first part of morpheme sequences DurPerf, DurPerfProg and DurProg.</li>
      <li>Do not add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Aspect=Res</code> (resultative) from Old Church Slavonic. It is used there for forms that are arguably <code class="highlighter-rouge">Aspect=Perf</code>.
And it should not be used to mark a particular form because in Slavic languages aspect is primarily a lexical feature (perfective vs. imperfective lemmas).</li>
      <li>Do not add sequences of aspect markings, which are currently used in Turkish and may be needed in other agglutinating languages. Leave them language-specific.
[tr] DurPerf, DurPerfProg, DurProg, ProgRapid.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/Voice</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Voice=Mid</code> (middle voice), currently used in fo, grc, grc_proiel, sa.</li>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Voice=Antip</code> (antipassive): in ergative-absolutive languages, an ergative subject is demoted to an absolutive subject. Proposed in UniMorph.</li>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Voice=Dir</code> (direct). Used in direct-inverse voice systems, e.g. in North American languages. Proposed in UniMorph.
Direct means that the argument that is higher in salience hierarchy is the subject.
Example hierarchy: human 1st person – 2nd – 3rd – non-human animate – inanimate.</li>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Voice=Inv</code> (inverse). Used in direct-inverse voice systems, e.g. in North American languages. Proposed in UniMorph.
Inverse voice marking means that the argument lower in the hierarchy functions as subject.</li>
      <li>TO DISCUSS: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Voice=Auto</code> (ga).</li>
      <li>Do not add sequences of voice markings, which are currently used in Turkish and may be needed in other agglutinating languages. Leave them language-specific.
[tr] CauPass.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/PronType</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">PronType=Emp</code> (emphatic) from Romanian. There are similarities with reflexive and demonstrative pronouns / determiners.
Example: <em>himself</em> as in “He himself did it.” Czech <em>sám</em>, Romanian <em>însuși</em>.</li>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">PronType=Exc</code> (exclamative) from Italian (but it can be defined in other languages, too). It expresses the
speaker’s surprise towards the modified noun, e.g. <em>what</em> in “What a surprise!” In many languages, exclamative
determiners are recruited from the set of interrogative determiners. Therefore, not all tagsets distinguish them.</li>
      <li>NOTE: The Italian data in UD v1 contain three additional values of <a href="it-feat/PronType">Italian</a>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Clit</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Predet</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ord</code>.
We do not propose to adopt these values as universal in UD v2. We propose to change the Italian guidelines so that these values
are no longer needed. See <a href="http://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/353">Issue 353</a> for details.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/NumType</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove <code class="highlighter-rouge">NumType=Gen</code>, it is poorely defined as a garbage can, some of the words should actually be cardinals, some are better classified as <code class="highlighter-rouge">NumType=Mult</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="">u-feat/Person</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person=0</code>. Proposed in UniMorph.
Zero person is for impersonal statements, appears in Finnish as well as in Santa Ana Pueblo Keres.
(The construction is distinctive in Finnish but it does not use unique morphology that would necessarily require
a feature; the current UD Finnish also lives without it.) However, it is morphologically distinct in Keres (Davis 1964:75).</li>
      <li>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person=4</code>. Proposed in UniMorph.
John: 4th person could be distinguished by additional, independently-needed features, such
as obviation status (e.g. proximate [prx] or obviative [obv], which are not included in
person features currently), so while the feature <code class="highlighter-rouge">4</code> is convenient and part of paradigmatic
contrasts (e.g. in Navajo), it may not be strictly necessary. The features proximate (prx)
and obviative (obv) should be included somehow if direct and inverse voice are allowed,
since languages that mark these voice categories tend to also mark 3rd person arguments
as proximate or obviative (esp. when all arguments in the clause are 3rd person).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="adding-new-features">Adding new features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Evident</code> (evidentiality) is currently used only in Turkish but it seems like this is an important feature in non-Indo-European languages.
We could take the values from UniMorph. At present we only need <code class="highlighter-rouge">Evident=Nfh</code> (non-first hand).</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Polite</code> (politeness) is currently used in 9 treebanks: ca, da, de, es, es_ancora, eu, hi, sa, ta.
UniMorph distinguishes four axes along which politeness may be scaled (see below), one of them covering another
feature currently used in a few UD treebanks, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Style</code>.
I propose to add, for the time being, the feature <code class="highlighter-rouge">Polite</code> with the UniMorph-like values from the speaker-referent
axis, i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Infm</code> (informal), <code class="highlighter-rouge">Form</code> (formal), <code class="highlighter-rouge">Elev</code> (elevated status of referent; interpreted as a subtype of
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Form</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">Humb</code> (humbled status of speaker; subtype of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Form</code>). That will let us cover the Indo-European tu/vous
pronouns, as well as part of Japanese honorifics.
    <ul>
      <li>TO DISCUSS:
The Turkish treebank has <code class="highlighter-rouge">Register</code>, which resembles politeness/style in having values <code class="highlighter-rouge">Form</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Inf</code>,
contrasting e.g. the 3rd person verb forms <em>etmekte</em> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Form</code>) and <em>ediyor</em> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Inf</code>) “he is doing”.
However, it is possible that the <em>-mekte</em> forms are restricted to more formal settings and do not
directly reflect the relation between the speaker and the addressee. If this is true, then they
are not covered by what we currently propose to cover under <code class="highlighter-rouge">Polite</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="cs-feat/Abbr">Abbr=Yes</a> (abbreviation) is not language-specific and is currently used in 12 treebanks: ar, cs, cs_cac, cs_cltt, da, et, fi, fi_ftb, fo, la_ittb, pl, ro.</li>
  <li><a href="cs-feat/Foreign">Foreign</a> is not language-specific and is currently used in 13 treebanks: ar, cs, cs_cac, da, de, es, et, fi, fo, hi, nl, sl, sl_sst.
The values should be discussed though.
The currently used values are <code class="highlighter-rouge">Foreign</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Fscript</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tscript</code> but most treebanks use only the first one. Alternatively we could make it just a binary feature,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Foreign=Yes</code>, which it was originally.</li>
  <li>TO DISCUSS: <code class="highlighter-rouge">NumForm=Digit|Roman|Word</code>.
The values can arguably be easily deduced from the word form; nevertheless, it is now used in 12 treebanks: ar, ca, cs, cs_cac, es_ancora, et, la_ittb, nl, pt, ro, sl, ta.
Inconsistency in Estonian: <code class="highlighter-rouge">NumForm=Letter</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Word</code>, which is used elsewhere.</li>
  <li>TO DISCUSS: <code class="highlighter-rouge">PartType</code> (particle type, not participle type). Given how diverse the <a href="">u-pos/PART</a> category is, it
would make sense to define its subcategories. Currently used in ga, da, nl, ro, with the following values:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Inf</code> (infinitive marker; used in ga, da, nl, ro),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Vbp</code> (used for separable verb prefixes in [nl] but they should be tagged <code class="highlighter-rouge">ADP</code>, not <code class="highlighter-rouge">PART</code>, and would not get this feature),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Ad</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cmpl</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Comp</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cop</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Deg</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Num</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pat</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Vb</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Voc</code> (meaning unknown, no documentation; used in Irish).
On the other hand, the function of the particle can sometimes (often?) be expressed using other features that already exist.
For instance, the particles marking infinitives could have the feature <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Inf</code>.
Similarly, negative particles like [en] <em>not</em> could have <code class="highlighter-rouge">Polarity=Neg</code>.</li>
  <li>TO DISCUSS: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Interrog</code> (interrogativity). In some sense it is parallel to (but separate from) polarity (negativity).
It may mark independent question particles, which exist in some languages (but note that these could also be covered
by <code class="highlighter-rouge">PartType=Int</code> if we approve the feature), as well as interrogative forms of verbs.
These currently appear in Irish and are tagged <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Int</code> there; however, the interrogative morphemes may probably
be combined with other mood categories (examples? Turkish?), which supports interrogativity as a separate feature.
It would not apply to interrogative pronouns, determiners and adverbs, which are already marked by <code class="highlighter-rouge">PronType=Int</code>—much
like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Polarity=Neg</code> is not used where <code class="highlighter-rouge">PronType=Neg</code> is. Similarly to polarity, the feature is proposed in UniMorph.
It has two values there, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Decl</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Int</code>, but the former is not expected to be used frequently (similar to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pos</code> in
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Polarity</code>) because declarativeness is usually not marked.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="comparison-with-unimorph">Comparison with UniMorph</h2>

<p>General differences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We work “bottom-up”. We wait for a feature to appear in a language (or source treebank), then we think about where to put it in the schema.
They work “top-down”. They surveyed literature on language typology and collected all features that could possibly occur in any natural language.</li>
  <li>Their schema “is responsible for capturing only the meanings of overt inflectional morphemes, which considerably limits the semantic space
that must be formally described by the UniMorph Schema features.”
In contrast, we also include some features that are not inflectional but they provide a more fine-grained partitioning of the part-of-speech space, e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">PronType</code>.</li>
  <li>They build upon the Leipzig Glossing Rules and their labels can be applied, if needed, to words, morphemes or phrases.
We focus on individual words and don’t mark some complex forms that can be expressed only periphrastically.
(But it is actually possible that UniMorph ignores periphrastic forms, too. They often stress that something is/is not
distinguished by overt affixal morphology. So maybe there is no difference in this point.)</li>
  <li>We need fully qualified feature+value pair to get a unique string, e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Degree=Sup</code> is something else than <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Sup</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Sup</code>.
They distinguish “dimensions” (our features) but their values are globally unique even without dimension name.
They also have templatic features (combined of several atoms), and they often rely on feature (value) combinations.
We have combined values too (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gender=Masc,Neut</code>) but for us it expresses disjunction, used when we cannot select just one of the values.
They have disjunction too, but they also mark conjunction of features, or elaboration, e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">IN+ABL</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="unimorph-dimensions-draft-v2">UniMorph dimensions (draft v2)</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Aktionsart</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">STAT</code> (stative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">DYN</code> (dynamic), <code class="highlighter-rouge">TEL</code> (telic), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ATEL</code> (atelic), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PCT</code> (punctual), <code class="highlighter-rouge">DUR</code> (durative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ACH</code> (achievement), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ACCMP</code> (accomplishment), <code class="highlighter-rouge">SEMEL</code> (semelfactive), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ACTY</code> (activity). Aktionsart is a feature that we don’t have in UD but it is closely related to our <a href="../u/feat/Aspect.html">Aspect</a>. Aspect in Slavic languages is treated as a lexical feature, change of aspect is considered a derivation. Perfective verbs in Slavic languages correspond to telic verbs in UniMorph, imperfective verbs correspond to atelic verbs and statives. However, aktionsart could be defined for other languages including English, while aspect is not marked in UD English.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Animacy</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">ANIM</code> (animate), <code class="highlighter-rouge">INAN</code> (inanimate), <code class="highlighter-rouge">HUM</code> (human), <code class="highlighter-rouge">NHUM</code> (non-human).
In UD we don’t have human but we do have the other three. We are now proposing to add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Animacy=Hum</code> to UD, see above.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Argument Marking</code> for head-marking languages. UniMorph uses templatic features <code class="highlighter-rouge">ARG</code>+<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case</code>+<code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code>+<code class="highlighter-rouge">Number</code>, e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">ARGNO1S</code> means that the nominative argument of the current verb is 1st person singular. Available cases are nominative, accusative, absolutive, ergative, dative, benefactive. We mostly only need to annotate agreement of the verb with its subject, i.e. the nominative argument, and we use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number</code> features of the verb for this. So far only Basque needs more, as the verbs may agree there with up to three arguments (absolutive, ergative and dative). We use the layered features, i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person[abs]</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person[erg]</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person[dat]</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number[abs]</code> etc.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Aspect</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">IPFV</code> (imperfective), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PFV</code> (perfective), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PRF</code> (perfect), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROG</code> (progressive), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROSP</code> (prospective), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ITER</code> (iterative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">HAB</code> (habitual).
Their aspect + aktionsart is not compatible with our aspect, although we have a few values in common (perfect/ive, imperfective, progressive, prospective).
We also mix aspect with tense by allowing the value <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tense=Imp</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Case</code>
    <ul>
      <li>Core case: can be defined in terms of three “meta-arguments,” S (subject), A (agent), and P (patient). Values:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">NOM</code> (nominative; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Nom</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ACC</code> (accusative; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Acc</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ERG</code> (ergative; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Erg</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ABS</code> (absolutive; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Abs</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">NOMS</code> (nominative, subject only).
We have all these values, except that we do not distinguish <code class="highlighter-rouge">NOMS</code> from <code class="highlighter-rouge">NOM</code>.</li>
      <li>Non-core, non-local case: <code class="highlighter-rouge">DAT</code> (dative; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Dat</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">BEN</code> (benefactive; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Ben</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PRP</code> (purposive; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Cau</code>),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">GEN</code> (genitive; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Gen</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">REL</code> (relative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PRT</code> (partitive; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Par</code>),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">INS</code> (instrumental; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Ins</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">COM</code> (comitative; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Com</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">VOC</code> (vocative; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Voc</code>),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">COMPV</code> (comparative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">EQTV</code> (equative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PRIV</code> (privative; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Abe</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROPR</code> (proprietive),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">AVR</code> (aversive), <code class="highlighter-rouge">FRML</code> (essive formal; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Ess</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">TRANS</code> (translative; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Tra</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">BYWAY</code> (essive modal).
We currently lack values of 6 cases in this category, although equative seems to already occur in our Turkish data (if it is what <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Equ</code> refers to).
Our causative (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Cau</code>) might be (or overlap with) UniMorph’s purposive.
Our abessive (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Abe</code>) is their privative; we use the term from Uralic languages, they from Australia.
Our essive/prolative (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Ess</code>, used in [hu, et, fi, eu]) is their essive formal.
Their essive modal (<code class="highlighter-rouge">BYWAY</code>) comes from Hungarian and “marks the notion of ‘by way of’ a location;” I suspect that we subsume it within instrumental.
Their relative (<code class="highlighter-rouge">REL</code>) “marks possessor and A role”, hence it looks like a merger of genitive and accusative.</li>
      <li>Local / place: <code class="highlighter-rouge">INTER</code> (“among”), <code class="highlighter-rouge">AT</code> (“at”), <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST</code> (“behind”), <code class="highlighter-rouge">IN</code> (“in”), <code class="highlighter-rouge">CIRC</code> (“near”), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ANTE</code> (“near, in front of”), <code class="highlighter-rouge">APUD</code> (“next to”),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ON</code> (“on”), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ONHR</code> (“on” horizontal), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ONVR</code> (“on” vertical), <code class="highlighter-rouge">SUB</code> (“under”).</li>
      <li>Local / distance: <code class="highlighter-rouge">REM</code> (distal), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROX</code> (proximate).</li>
      <li>Local / motion: <code class="highlighter-rouge">ESS</code> (essive), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ALL</code> (allative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ABL</code> (ablative).</li>
      <li>Local / aspect: <code class="highlighter-rouge">APPRX</code> (approximative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">TERM</code> (terminative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROL</code> (prolative/translative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">VERS</code> (versative).</li>
      <li>UD has <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Loc</code>, which is used in a number of Indo-European languages (especially Slavic) but also in Basque, Turkish and others.
It has mostly a locative meaning, where the placement and direction are not precisely specified. It can also have a non-locative meaning.
The closest counterpart of the locative case in UniMorph is plain <code class="highlighter-rouge">ESS</code>.</li>
      <li>The UniMorph draft accounts for compositionality of locative morphemes in some languages: “from [the place] between us” could be encoded as <em>we</em> + <code class="highlighter-rouge">INTER</code> + <code class="highlighter-rouge">ABL</code>.
In contrast, we use established terms for some of the combinations but definitely cannot encode all possible combinations in all languages.
Our local cases are:
inessive (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Ine</code>; <code class="highlighter-rouge">IN+ESS</code>); illative (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Ill</code>; <code class="highlighter-rouge">IN+ALL</code>); elative (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Ela</code>; <code class="highlighter-rouge">IN+ABL</code>);
adessive (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Ade</code>; <code class="highlighter-rouge">ON/AT+ESS</code>); allative (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=All</code>; <code class="highlighter-rouge">ON/AT+ALL</code>); ablative (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Abl</code>; <code class="highlighter-rouge">ON/AT+ABL</code>);
superessive (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Sup</code>; <code class="highlighter-rouge">ON/ONVR+ESS</code>); sublative (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Sub</code>; <code class="highlighter-rouge">ON+ALL</code>); delative (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Del</code>; <code class="highlighter-rouge">ON/ONVR+ABL</code>);
lative (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Lat</code>; <code class="highlighter-rouge">ALL</code>, i.e. it says it’s motion towards something, without distinguishing on/at/in/under);
terminative (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Ter</code>; <code class="highlighter-rouge">ALL+TERM</code>, i.e. it specifies motion up to some point, also called terminal allative).</li>
      <li>They do not have additive <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Add</code> because they encode atomic meaning and additive is equal in meaning to illative.
It is questionable whether we want to keep it in UD but I would keep it because it is actively used in UD Estonian, so there apparently is some demand.</li>
      <li>They currently do not have
temporal <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Tem</code> (hu) and
distributive <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Dis</code> (hu).</li>
      <li>We should add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Equ</code> to the universal features. We already use it in Turkish.
Similarly, we should add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Cmp</code> for comparative (“than X”), occurring in Dravidian and Northeast-Caucasian languages.</li>
      <li>We do not have <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Prp</code> for proprietive (“having X”), a positive counterpart of abessive, occurring in Australian languages.
(But we have comitative <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Com</code> which can also be viewed as a positive counterpart of abessive.)
There appears to be debate about whether proprietive is in fact inflectional or derivational.
Blake (2001:156) cites only Kalkatungu (an extinct Pama-Nyungan language from Queensland) as a specific example.
Moreover, Heine and Kuteva (2002:88) identify a historical grammaticalization pathway for comitative case to the sense of “having”.</li>
      <li>We do not have <code class="highlighter-rouge">Case=Avr</code> for aversive (“fearing X”).
Blake (2001:156) notes that this case is “common in Australian languages” but only provides Kalkatungu as an example.</li>
      <li>As for the local cases, there are too many possible combinations and we should probably wait until the need for one of them arises.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Comparison</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">CMPR</code> (comparative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">SPRL</code> (superlative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">AB</code> (absolute for superlatives), <code class="highlighter-rouge">RL</code> (relative for superlatives), <code class="highlighter-rouge">EQT</code> (equative).
We have <code class="highlighter-rouge">Degree=Cmp</code> for comparative, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Degree=Sup</code> for relative superlative (<code class="highlighter-rouge">SPRL+RL</code>) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Degree=Abs</code> for absolute superlative (<code class="highlighter-rouge">SPRL+AB</code>).
We also have <code class="highlighter-rouge">Degree=Pos</code> (positive) that denotes the basic degree, i.e. adjective that is not compared.
This comes from traditional grammars of various languages, although it would be possible to tag such adjectives by omitting the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Degree</code> feature.
We could not distinguish adjectives that cannot take the comparative/superlative morphemes, but in fact we avoid that distinction with most features.
On the other hand, we do not have the equative degree (note that it marks the adjective and it is distinct from the equative case, which marks
the standard of comparison). One of the examples in UniMorph is Estonian <em><b>pikkune</b> (pikkus+ne)</em> “as tall as”.
UD Estonian contains 6 occurrences of <em>pikkune</em> but it does not define equative as a language-specific feature; it uses simply <code class="highlighter-rouge">Degree=Pos</code> here.
We may want to define the value <code class="highlighter-rouge">Degree=Equ</code> and see if anyone uses it.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Definiteness</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">DEF</code> (definite), <code class="highlighter-rouge">INDF</code> (indefinite), <code class="highlighter-rouge">SPEC</code> (specific), <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSPEC</code> (non-specific).
The last two are elaboration of indefinite. Specific indefinite: <em>a certain stick</em>; non-specific indefinite: <em>any stick but still only one, not many</em>.
We have <code class="highlighter-rouge">Definite=Def</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Definite=Ind</code>.
If we include the distinction of specificity, it will be just one value cutting off the current <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ind</code>, maybe <code class="highlighter-rouge">Definite=Spec</code>.
On the other hand, we have two peculiar values coming from the Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Definite=Red</code> (reduced) is used for noun that is modified by another noun in genitive and has neither definite nor indefinite morpheme.
This is also called the <em>construct state</em> and appears in other Semitic languages, e.g. Hebrew.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Definite=Com</code> (complex) is used in <em>improper annexation / false iḍāfa</em> (related to the construct state but more complex) in Arabic.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Deixis</code> subclassifies demonstrative pronouns, which in some languages are also used instead of 3rd person pronouns.
We have only <code class="highlighter-rouge">PronType=Dem</code> (or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Prs</code>) but we do not distinguish the other dimensions at present.
At least distance would make sense for the languages we already have in UD, but the original tagsets did not care about it.
    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Distance</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROX</code> (proximate), <code class="highlighter-rouge">MED</code> (medial), <code class="highlighter-rouge">REMT</code> (remote).</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Reference Point</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">REF1</code> (speaker), <code class="highlighter-rouge">REF2</code> (addressee), <code class="highlighter-rouge">NOREF</code> (distal, i.e. neither speaker nor addressee),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">PHOR</code> (phoric, i.e. either anaphoric or cataphoric; previously mentioned or to be disambiguated).
This feature sometimes overlaps with distance and sometimes is explicitly separated.</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Visibility</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">VIS</code> (visible), <code class="highlighter-rouge">NVIS</code> (not visible).</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Verticality</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">ABV</code> (above the level plane of the speaker), <code class="highlighter-rouge">EVEN</code> (at the same level), <code class="highlighter-rouge">BEL</code> (below the level of the speaker).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Evidentiality</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">FH</code> (firsthand), <code class="highlighter-rouge">DRCT</code> (direct), <code class="highlighter-rouge">SEN</code> (sensory), <code class="highlighter-rouge">VISU</code> (visual), <code class="highlighter-rouge">NVSEN</code> (non-visual sensory), <code class="highlighter-rouge">AUD</code> (auditory),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">NFH</code> (non-firsthand), <code class="highlighter-rouge">QUOT</code> (quotative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">RPRT</code> (reported), <code class="highlighter-rouge">HRSY</code> (hearsay), <code class="highlighter-rouge">INFER</code> (inferred), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ASSUM</code> (assumed).
UD v1 does not have this feature, although we have <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Qot</code> (et, lv) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tense=Nar</code> (re-narrative past tense; the value was intended
for Turkish but in the end it was not used there, and language-specific <code class="highlighter-rouge">Evidentiality=Nfh</code> was introduced instead.
We propose to make <code class="highlighter-rouge">Evidentiality</code> a universal feature in UD v2. Maybe we can just adopt the values used in UniMorph.
We will have to check how it interacts with the quotative mood in Estonian and Latvian.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Finiteness</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">FIN</code> (finite), <code class="highlighter-rouge">NFIN</code> (nonfinite). We have <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Fin</code> for finite, any other verbform is nonfinite.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Gender and Noun Class</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">MASC</code> (masculine), <code class="highlighter-rouge">FEM</code> (feminine), <code class="highlighter-rouge">NEUT</code> (neuter), <code class="highlighter-rouge">BANTU1-23</code> (noun classes in Bantu languages),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">NAKH1-8</code> (noun classes in Nakh-Daghestanian languages). We have <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gender=Masc</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Fem</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Neut</code> for the three genders;
in addition, we have <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gender=Com</code> for the common gender in Scandinavian languages, which only distinguish <em>neutrum</em> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Neut</code>) and <em>utrum</em> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Com</code>).
At present we do not cover any Bantu or Nakh-Daghestanian language.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Information Structure</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">TOP</code> (topic), <code class="highlighter-rouge">FOC</code> (focus).
We do not have a feature for information structure but there are not many languages where it is marked via overt affixal morphology.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Interrogativity</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">DECL</code> (declarative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">INT</code> (interrogative). Used for verbs.
We do not have a feature for this. <code class="highlighter-rouge">PronType=Int</code> could be possibly abused to encode verbs with interrogative morpheme,
but it would be much better not to mix the feature with pronominal types; we also don’t mix <code class="highlighter-rouge">Negative=Neg</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">PronType=Neg</code>.</li>
  <li>Language-specific features <code class="highlighter-rouge">LGSPEC1</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">LGSPEC2</code> etc. UniMorph uses them to distinguish alternating forms whose selection is not
tied to meaning. For example, genitive of German <em>Buch</em> is either <em>Buchs</em> or <em>Buches</em>. One form will be <code class="highlighter-rouge">LGSPEC1</code> and the other
<code class="highlighter-rouge">LGSPEC2</code>. We do not have anything similar in UD.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">IND</code> (indicative, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Ind</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">SBJV</code> (subjunctive, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Sub</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">REAL</code> (realis), <code class="highlighter-rouge">IRR</code> (irrealis), <code class="highlighter-rouge">AUPRP</code> (Australian purposive),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">AUNPRP</code> (Australian non-purposive), <code class="highlighter-rouge">IMP</code> (imperative-jussive, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Imp</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Jus</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">COND</code> (conditional, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Moos=Cnd</code>),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">PURP</code> (general purposive, “in order to”), <code class="highlighter-rouge">INTEN</code> (intentive), <code class="highlighter-rouge">POT</code> (potential, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Pot</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">LKLY</code> (likely),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ADM</code> (admirative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">OBLIG</code> (obligative, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Nec</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">DEB</code> (debitive, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Nec</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PERM</code> (permissive), <code class="highlighter-rouge">DED</code> (deductive), <code class="highlighter-rouge">SIM</code> (simulative, “as if”),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">OPT</code> (optative-desiderative, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Opt</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Des</code>).
    <ul>
      <li>We do not have realis and irrealis but I wonder whether we actually have to distinguish them from indicative and subjunctive, respectively.</li>
      <li>There are no Australian languages in UD at present, and we do not encode the Australian purposive vs. non-purposive.
The discussion in UniMorph suggests that the non-purposive vs. purposive opposition can be viewed as on par with
the realis vs. irrealis and indicative vs. subjunctive oppositions.</li>
      <li>Imperatives are direct commands for the addressee while hortatives and jussives include more suggestive forms,
such as “let them/us X”. They just conflate all three to <code class="highlighter-rouge">IMP</code> (imperative-jussive).
We have a separate label for jussive but we only use it in Arabic. Nevertheless, Arabic also has the imperative, so it makes sense to distinguish the two values.</li>
      <li>UniMorph conflates optative and desiderative into one mood, <code class="highlighter-rouge">OPT</code>, while we have both <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Opt</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Des</code>.
UD Turkish uses both values but the Turkish documentation says that desiderative is morphologically identical to conditional, so it is questionable whether we want to keep <code class="highlighter-rouge">Des</code> there.
In addition, optative is used in Finnish, Gothic, Ancient Greek and Sanskrit.</li>
      <li>John’s comment on conditional: ambiguous between designating the <em>protasis / condition</em> (“if it rained”),
and the <em>apodosis / result</em> from that condition being fulfilled (“, the game would be cancelled”).
Languages differ in whether the conditional applies to the protasis, the apodosis or both.
Spanish uses the conditional for the protasis, but subjunctive imperfect for the apodosis.</li>
      <li>UniMorph distinguishes debitive from obligative while we have only one corresponding value, necessitative.</li>
      <li>Other moods that are used in UD Turkish: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Abil</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">AbilCnd</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">AbilDes</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">AbilGen</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">AbilGenNec</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">AbilImp</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">AbilNec</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">AbilPrs</code>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Gen</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">GenNec</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Prs</code>. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Abil</code> should probably be replaced by the universal feature <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mood=Pot</code> (potential).
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Prs</code> means persuasive, reportedly related to imperative but different in that we try to persuade the addressee to do something instead of just commanding.</li>
      <li>We currently lack values for purposive, intentive, admirative, permissive, deductive and simulative, and we may want to add them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Number</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">SG</code> (singular, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number=Sing</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PL</code> (plural, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number=Plur</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">DU</code> (dual, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number=Dual</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">TRI</code> (trial), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PAUC</code> (paucal),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">GPAUC</code> (greater paucal), <code class="highlighter-rouge">GRPL</code> (greater plural), <code class="highlighter-rouge">INVN</code> (inverse).
    <ul>
      <li>We may want to add values <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number=Tri</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pauc</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Grpa</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Grpl</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Inv</code>.</li>
      <li>We have two additional values, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptan</code> (plurale tantum) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Coll</code> (singulare tantum), which may be viewed as elaboration of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Sing</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Plur</code>, respectively,
and which encode an inherent property of nouns rather than inflection. Agreeing adjectives and verbs never take this value, they use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Sing</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Plur</code> instead.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Part of Speech</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> (noun), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROPN</code> (proper name), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ADJ</code> (adjective), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PRO</code> (pronoun), <code class="highlighter-rouge">CLF</code> (classifier), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ART</code> (article),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">DET</code> (determiner), <code class="highlighter-rouge">V</code> (verb), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ADV</code> (adverb), <code class="highlighter-rouge">AUX</code> (auxiliary), <code class="highlighter-rouge">V.PTCP</code> (participle, verbal adjective), <code class="highlighter-rouge">V.MSDR</code> (masdar, verbal noun), <code class="highlighter-rouge">V.CVB</code> (converb, verbal adverb),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ADP</code> (adposition), <code class="highlighter-rouge">COMP</code> (complementizer), <code class="highlighter-rouge">CONJ</code> (conjunction), <code class="highlighter-rouge">NUM</code> (numeral), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PART</code> (particle), <code class="highlighter-rouge">INTJ</code> (interjection)
    <ul>
      <li>We do not have a separate tag for classifiers. I believe that we subsume them under nouns in UD Chinese.</li>
      <li>We subsume articles within determiners but we distinguish them by <code class="highlighter-rouge">PronType=Art</code>.</li>
      <li>We do not treat participles, verbal nouns and verbal adverbs as separate parts of speech.
We distinguish them by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm</code> feature and we allow language-specific guidelines to put them under <code class="highlighter-rouge">VERB</code>, or under <code class="highlighter-rouge">ADJ/NOUN/ADV</code>.
Our v1 guidelines propose to call verbal nouns gerunds (<code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Ger</code>). This is motivated by the English gerunds but it should
probably be revised because the term has quite different meaning in different languages, which causes confusion.
On the other hand, I do not quite like the term <em>masdar</em> used in UniMorph, which is taken from Arabic but not widely understood elsewhere.
Perhaps <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Vnoun</code> would be enough? (Note that infinitives can also be used like nouns in some languages; these would keep <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Inf</code>.)
In contrast, I find the term <em>converb</em> (Haspelmath, 1995) quite appropriate and language-neutral. We currently use <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Trans</code> (transgressive)
but this term turned out to be known only in a few Slavic languages. So we may rename it to <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Conv</code> (or maybe <code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbForm=Vadv</code>, verbal adverb, adverbial participle).</li>
      <li>They have a tag for auxiliary verbs while we are now proposing to get rid of it.</li>
      <li>Unlike us, they conflate coordinating and subordinating conjunctions in one tag <code class="highlighter-rouge">CONJ</code>.
However, they have a separate tag for complementizers while we include them in <code class="highlighter-rouge">SCONJ</code>.</li>
      <li>Like us, they distinguish <code class="highlighter-rouge">NUM</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PART</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">INTJ</code>. They actually refer to us when explaining why they include these categories.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">4</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">INCL</code> (inclusive <em>we</em>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">EXCL</code> (exclusive <em>we</em>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PRX</code> (proximate), <code class="highlighter-rouge">OBV</code> (obviative).
We have only the classical 1st–3rd persons. Zero person is for impersonal statements, appears in Finnish as well as in Santa Ana Pueblo Keres.
The fourth person is used in some languages to describe an otherwise third-person referent that is differentiated from other third-person referents.
Clusivity could be encoded as a separate language-specific feature, which would be in line with UniMorph, which combines <code class="highlighter-rouge">1+INCL</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">1+EXCL</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Polarity</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">NEG</code> (negative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">POS</code> (positive, affirmative). We have been calling the feature <code class="highlighter-rouge">Negative(ness)</code> but we propose to rename it to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Polarity</code> in UD v2.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Politeness</code>: ve have it only as a language-specific feature, used rarely.
    <ul>
      <li>Speaker-Referent Axis (whether or not the referent happens to also be the addressee).
<code class="highlighter-rouge">INFM</code> (informal; the <em>tu</em> 2nd person singular pronoun in Indo-European languages.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">FORM</code> (formal; the <em>vous</em> 2nd person singular pronoun in Indo-European languages.
Sublevels of the formal level:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">FORM+ELEV</code> (referent elevating; sonkeigo forms in Japanese).
<code class="highlighter-rouge">FORM+HUMB</code> (speaker humbling; kenjougo forms in Japanese).</li>
      <li>Speaker-Addressee Axis (not referring to the addressee).
Japanese teineigo is an example of an addressee honorific system.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">POL</code> (polite), <code class="highlighter-rouge">MPOL</code> (medium polite).</li>
      <li>Speaker-Bystander Axis.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">AVOID</code> (avoidance style, taboo language = used in the presence of anyone to whom the avoidance relationship applies, e.g. mother-in-law),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">LOW</code> (low status = language used in the presence of only those having a low status),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">HIGH</code> (high status = in the presence of the secondary chief(tess)),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">STELV</code> (elevated status = in the presence of the primary chieftess),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">STSUPR</code> (supreme status = in the presence of the primary chief).
The neutral level is unspecified.</li>
      <li>Speaker-Setting Axis; referred to as <em>register</em> in sociolinguistics.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">LIT</code> (literary, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Style=Form</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">FOREG</code> (formal register, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Style=Form</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">COL</code> (colloquial, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Style=Coll</code>).
We have corresponding features in the section of language-specific extensions but they are currently used only in a few treebanks (cs, da, fi).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Possession</code> is a templatic feature that may incorporate features of the possessor such as person and number.
We encode the same situation using the boolean feature <code class="highlighter-rouge">Poss=Yes</code>, and separate features for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number</code> etc.
If it is necessary to distinguish them from same-named inflectional features of the possessive word, we use layered features on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">[psor]</code> (“possessor”) layer:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Person[psor]</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Number[psor]</code> etc.
UniMorph defines the following combinations:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS1S</code> (possession by 1st person singular), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS2S</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS2SM</code> (2nd person singular masculine), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS2SF</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS2SINFM</code> (informal), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS2SFORM</code>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS3S</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS3SM</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS3SF</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS1D</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS1DI</code> (dual inclusive), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS1DE</code> (exclusive), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS2D</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS2DM</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS2DF</code>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS3D</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS3DM</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS3DF</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS1P</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS1PI</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS1PE</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS2P</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS2PM</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS2PF</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS3P</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS3PM</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSS3PF</code>.
In addition, they define simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">PSSD</code> (possessive but without marking features of the possessor), and also
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ALN</code> for alienable and <code class="highlighter-rouge">NALN</code> for inalienable possession. Alienable means that the ownership can change (“my house”) while inalienable means
that it cannot change (“my back”).</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Switch Reference</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">SS</code> (same subject), <code class="highlighter-rouge">DS</code> (different subject), <code class="highlighter-rouge">SSADV</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">DSADV</code>.
When there are two verbs in a row, switch-reference is morphological marking of whether they have or do not have the same subject.
We do not have this feature in UD.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Tense</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">PRS</code> (present, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tense=Pres</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PST</code> (past, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tense=Past</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">FUT</code> (future, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tense=Fut</code>),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">IMMED</code> (immediate), <code class="highlighter-rouge">HOD</code> (hodiernal, i.e. today), <code class="highlighter-rouge">1DAY</code> (within one day), <code class="highlighter-rouge">RCT</code> (recent), <code class="highlighter-rouge">RMT</code> (remote).
    <ul>
      <li>They envisage combining their features, e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">FUT+HOD</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">PST+RCT</code>.</li>
      <li>We currently only have present, past and future without the more specific values like recent and remote.</li>
      <li>Moreover, we cover two present-aspect combinations that may have separate morphological forms and sometimes cannot be represented by <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tense</code> + <code class="highlighter-rouge">Aspect</code> because there
is also the lexical aspect (as in Bulgarian). We would have to redesign our scheme and add aktionsart, or use two layered aspects on one word to solve this.
The combinations are <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tense=Imp</code> (imperfect tense) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tense=Pqp</code> (pluperfect).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Valency</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">IMPRS</code> (impersonal), <code class="highlighter-rouge">INTR</code> (intransitive), <code class="highlighter-rouge">TR</code> (transitive), <code class="highlighter-rouge">DITR</code> (ditransitive), <code class="highlighter-rouge">REFL</code> (reflexive), <code class="highlighter-rouge">RECP</code> (reciprocal), <code class="highlighter-rouge">CAUS</code> (causative), <code class="highlighter-rouge">APPL</code> (applicative).
At present we do not have a valency feature in UD. We only have a suggestion for a language-specific feature, with only two values,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Subcat=Intr</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Subcat=Tran</code>, which are currently used only in UD Dutch.
We do account for causativity and reciprocality in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Voice</code> feature.
We also have a boolean feature <code class="highlighter-rouge">Reflex=Yes</code> but most of the time we use it to mark reflexive pronouns.
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Valency</code> feature in UniMorph captures number of arguments (arity) of the verb: e.g. the causative morpheme adds one participant (the person who is forced to do the thing).
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Voice</code> feature in UD is more about switching roles of the participants. Obviously, the two features must interact with each other.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Voice</code>, values: <code class="highlighter-rouge">ACT</code> (active, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Voice=Act</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">MID</code> (middle, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Voice=Mid</code>), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PASS</code> (passive, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Voice=Pass</code>),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ANTIP</code> (antipassive), <code class="highlighter-rouge">DIR</code> (direct), <code class="highlighter-rouge">INV</code> (inverse),
<code class="highlighter-rouge">AGFOC</code> (agent focus), <code class="highlighter-rouge">PFOC</code> (patient focus), <code class="highlighter-rouge">LFOC</code> (location focus), <code class="highlighter-rouge">BFOC</code> (beneficiary focus), <code class="highlighter-rouge">ACFOC</code> (accompanier focus), <code class="highlighter-rouge">IFOC</code> (instrument focus), <code class="highlighter-rouge">CFOC</code> (conveyed focus).</li>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">AdpType</code> distinguishes prepositions from postpositions, but also a few other types. It is used in a number of treebanks, but the usage is not consistent and I have some doubts whether it is useful. Many languages have a strong preference towards either pre- or postpositions.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">AdvType</code> potentially useful in many languages but currently almost unused.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Clitic</code> specific to Finnish</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">ConjType</code> used only in Czech</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Connegative</code> Finnish and Estonian</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Derivation</code> specific to Finnish</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Dialect</code> used only in Irish</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Echo=Rdp</code> (reduplicative), used in Hindi and Turkish</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Form</code> specific to Irish</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">HebBinyan</code> specific to Hebrew (but I believe it could be converted to aspect and voice)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">HebExistential</code> specific to Hebrew</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">HebSource</code> debugging feature</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Hyph=Yes</code> used only in a few treebanks</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">InfForm</code> specific to Finnish</li>

  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">NounType</code> specific to Irish</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">NumValue</code> used in Czech and Arabic</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PartForm</code> specific to Finnish</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Position</code> used only in Romanian</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Prefix=Yes</code> specific to Hebrew</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PrepCase</code> used in Catalan, Czech, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PrepForm</code> specific to Irish (maybe it could be renamed to <code class="highlighter-rouge">AdpType</code>, which is used elsewhere)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PunctSide</code> used in ca, es_ancora, fi_ftb, nl</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PunctType</code> used in ca, es_ancora, nl, ta; not consistent</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Style</code> used in Czech, Danish and Finnish</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Subcat</code> used only in Dutch</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Typo=Yes</code> could be useful in all treebanks but we first need a general guideline for handling typos. Should the form in FORM be original, or fixed? And should we have a MISC attribute with the fixed or original form? See also <a href="https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/330">issue 330</a>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Variant</code>; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Variant=Brev</code> in Russian denotes the short-form adjective (<em>холоден</em>, as opposed to <em>холодный</em>), which
are distinguished by definiteness in South Slavic, and by <code class="highlighter-rouge">Variant=Short</code> (vs. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Long</code>) in West Slavic. Maybe this
opposition would deserve a Slavic-specific feature, <code class="highlighter-rouge">AdjForm=Short|Long</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">VerbType=Aux|Mod|Cop|Main</code>; currently used in Hebrew, Dutch and Latin; it has to be seen how much such a feature will be demanded if we remove the <code class="highlighter-rouge">AUX</code> tag.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Xtra=Junk</code> used in Hebrew</li>
