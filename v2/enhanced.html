        <h1 id="enhanced-dependencies-in-ud-v2">Enhanced Dependencies in UD v2</h1>

<p>The first version of the guidelines provided very little guidance regarding the <em>enhanced</em> representation and so far only very few treebanks contain additional dependencies. For v2, we propose the following guidelines for the <em>enhanced</em> representation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The enhanced representation should include:
    <ul>
      <li>Null nodes for elided predicates</li>
      <li>Propagation of conjuncts</li>
      <li>Additional subject relations for control and raising constructions</li>
      <li>Arguments of passives (and other valency-changing constructions)</li>
      <li>Coreference in relative clause constructions</li>
      <li>Modifier labels that contain the preposition or other case-marking information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <em>enhanced</em> graph is not necessarily a supergraph of the basic tree, i.e., it is not required to contain all the basic dependency relations</li>
  <li>In principle, everything in the enhanced representation is an optional addition to the basic representation, but we specify a recommended order for adding information (as guidance to treebank developers)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ellipsis">Ellipsis</h2>

<p>(See also the notes on <a href="ellipsis.html">ellipsis</a>.)</p>

<p>In the <em>enhanced</em> representation, we add special null nodes in clauses in which a predicate is elided.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">I like tea and you E5.1 coffee .

nsubj(like-2, I-1)
obj(like-2, tea-3)
nsubj(E5.1-6, you-5)
conj(like-2, E5.1-6)
obj(E5.1-6, coffee-7)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Mary wants to buy a book and Jenny E8.1 E8.2 a CD .

nsubj(wants-2, Mary-1)
xcomp(wants-2, buy-4)
obj(buy-4, book-6)
conj(wants-2, E8.1-9)
nsubj(E8.1-9, Jenny-8)
xcomp(E8.1-9, E8.2-10)
obj(E8.2-10, CD-12)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is a case in which the <em>enhanced</em> UD graph is not a supergraph of the <em>basic</em> tree as the <em>basic</em> tree contains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">orphan</code> relations, which are not present in the <em>enhanced</em> UD graph.</p>

<h2 id="controlledraised-subjects">Controlled/raised subjects</h2>

<p>The <em>basic</em> trees lack a subject dependency between a controlled verb and its controller or between an embedded verb and its raised subject. In the <em>enhanced</em> graph, there is an additional dependency between the embedded verb and the subject of the matrix clause.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Mary wants to buy a book .

nsubj(wants, Mary)
xcomp(wants, buy)
nsubj(buy, Mary)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">She seems to be reading a book .

nsubj(seems, She)
xcomp(seems, reading)
nsubj(reading, She)
</code></pre>

<!--### To discuss

* Should we use a special relation (e.g., `nsubj:xsubj`) for these additional relations? -->

<h2 id="propagation-of-conjuncts">Propagation of Conjuncts</h2>

<p>In the <em>basic</em> representation, the governor and dependents of a conjoined phrase are all attached to the first conjunct. The <em>enhanced</em> representation also contains dependencies between the other conjuncts and the governor and dependents of the phrase.</p>

<h3 id="conjoined-verbs-and-verb-phrases">Conjoined verbs and verb phrases</h3>

<p>When two verbs share their objects (or other complements), the subject and the object of the conjoined verbs are attached to every conjunct.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">The store buys and sells cameras .

nsubj(buys, store)
nsubj(sells, store)
conj(buys, sells)
obj(buys, cameras)
obj(sells, cameras)
</code></pre>

<p>However, if the complements of the second verb are not shared, only the subject is attached to every conjunct.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">She was reading or watching a movie .

nsubj(reading, She)
nsubj(watching, She)
conj(reading, watching)
obj(watching, movie)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="conjoined-subjects-and-objects">Conjoined subjects and objects</h3>

<p>When the subject is a conjoined noun phrase, each of the conjuncts is attached to the predicate.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Paul and Mary are running .

nsubj(running, Paul)
nsubj(running, Mary)
conj(Paul, Mary)
</code></pre>

<p>The same is true for conjoined objects.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Paul bought apples and oranges .

nsubj(bought, Paul)
obj(bought, apples)
obj(bought, oranges)
conj(apples, oranges)
</code></pre>

<p>This leads to slightly strange dependencies in the case of collective subjects or objects:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Paul and Mary are meeting .

nsubj(meeting, Paul)
nsubj(meeting, Mary)
conj(Paul, Mary)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Mary is eating mac and cheese .

nsubj(eating, Mary)
obj(eating, mac)
conj(mac, cheese)
obj(eating, cheese)
</code></pre>

<p>However, as the distinction between distributive and collective readings is often context-dependent, we propose to take the simplest approach and to always attach all conjuncts to the predicate.</p>

<p>When the subject is attached to a control or raising predicate, there is a dependency between the matrix verb and each conjunct and between the embedded verb and each conjunct.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Mary and John wanted to buy a hat .

nsubj(wanted, Mary)
nsubj(wanted, John)
conj(Mary, John)
xcomp(wanted, buy)
nsubj(buy, Mary)
nsubj(buy, John)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="conjoined-modifiers">Conjoined modifiers</h3>

<p>Each conjunct in a conjoined modifier phrase gets attached to the governor of the modifier phrase. For example, the following phrase contains a conjoined adjectival phrase that modifies a noun. In the enhanced representation, there is an additional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amod</code> relation between the noun <em>river</em> and the second conjunct <em>wide</em>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">a long and wide river

amod(river, long)
amod(river, wide)
conj(long, wide)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="arguments-of-passive-verbs">Arguments of passive verbs</h2>

<p>(See also the notes on <a href="core-dependents.html">core dependents</a> for a detailed discussion of the new analysis of passive constructions in the <em>basic</em> representation.)</p>

<p>We propose that we no longer use a special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nsubjpass</code> relation in the <em>basic</em> representation. However, the distiction between regular subjects and subjects in passive constructions is still highly useful for many NLP tasks. We therefore propose to use the relations <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nsubj:pass</code> <!--(for languages without `dobj`/`iobj` distinction), `nsubj:passdir`, `nsubj:passind`,-->and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obl:agent</code> for the arguments of a passivized verb.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">The book was written by the author .

nsubj:pass(written, book)
obl:agent(written, author)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">She was given the book .

nsubj:pass(given, She)
obj(given, book)
</code></pre>

<!-- ### To discuss

* Should the _enhanced_ UD graph still contain the original subject dependencies or should we only have `nsubj:pass(dir|ind)`?
* Should this treatment be extended to other valency-changing constructions like causatives and antipassives?

Example [tr] (_Bilge made Deniz wash the car._):

~~~ sdparse
Bilge arabayı Denize yıkattı . \n Bilge the.car Deniz made.wash .

nsubj:cau(yıkattı, Denize)
dobj(yıkattı, arabayı)
nsubj(yıkattı, Bilge)
~~~
-->

<h2 id="relative-clauses">Relative clauses</h2>

<p>In <em>basic</em> trees, relative pronouns are attached to the main predicate of the relative clause (typically with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nsubj</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dobj</code> relation). In the corresponding <em>enhanced</em> graphs, the relative pronoun is attached to what it is referring to with the special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref</code> relation and the governor of the relative clause is attached as an argument to the main predicate of the relative clause. Note that such graphs contain a cycle.</p>

<p><em>Basic</em> tree:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">The boy who lived .

acl:relcl(boy, lived)
nsubj(lived, who)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Enhanced</em> graph:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">The boy who lived .

acl:relcl(boy, lived)
ref(boy, who)
nsubj(lived, boy)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Basic</em> tree:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">The book that I read .

acl:relcl(book, read)
obj(read, that)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Enhanced</em> graph:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">The book that I read .

acl:relcl(book, read)
ref(book, that)
obj(read, book)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="case-information">Case Information</h2>

<p>Adding prepositions (or case information) to the relation name of non-core dependents often makes it possible to disambiguate its  semantic role. We therefore augment <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nmod</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obl</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">acl</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">advcl</code> relation labels with the preposition or the case of the modifier.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">the house on the hill

nmod:on(house, hill)
case(hill, on)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">He went to a diner after leaving work .

obl:to(went, diner)
case(diner, to)
advcl:after(went, leaving)
mark(leaving, after)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">die Zerstörung der Stadt \n the destruction the.GEN city.GEN

nmod:gen(Zerstörung, Stadt)
</code></pre>

<!-- ### To discuss

* Should we use special relation names (e.g., `nsubj:xsubj`) for the indirect relations? 
* Should this treatment be extended to relative pronouns that refer to adnominal or adverbial modifiers? 
* What should we do with dependents of the relative pronoun such as case markers?

Examples:

~~~ sdparse
The house in which I used to live .

acl:relcl(house, used)
advnom(live, house)
case(which, in)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
The city where I used to live .

acl:relcl(city, used)
advnom(live, city)
~~~
-->

<h2 id="recommended-order-of-annotations">Recommended order of annotations</h2>

<p>We are aware that adding all of the discussed relations for the <em>enhanced</em> representation will require a significant amount of work. Further, many treebanks have been automatically converted from existing treebanks and many of them might contain only some of the information that is needed to add the relations for the <em>enhanced</em> representation. At the same time, we believe that having some of the additional relations is better than not having any additional relations at all. We therefore leave it up to the treebank maintainers how much of this proposal they want to implement.</p>

<p>However, maintainers should be aware that the different types of relations are not completely independent of each other and adding one type of information (e.g., null nodes) might require changes to existing additional relations. If the additional relations are added manually, we recommend the following order of annotations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Null nodes</li>
  <li>Propagation of conjuncts</li>
  <li>Controllers and raised subjects</li>
  <li>Relative clauses, passive arguments, and augmentation of relation names with case information</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="additional-enhancements">Additional enhancements</h2>

<p>Some postprocessing steps such as demoting light nouns that behave like quantificational determiners (as described in <a href="http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2016/pdf/779_Paper.pdf">this paper</a>) can improve the usability of the dependency graphs for downstream applications. However, as most of these additions are highly language-specific, we do not provide any universal guidelines for such a representation and anything beyond the above additions is not part of the UD standard and should not be added to the officially released treebanks.</p>
