## Constructions

* We should have pages discussing constructions that exist in many languages.
* The list of constructions will be developed in the process of working out proposals for constructions. This will probably be a combination of a bottom-up (constructions suggested by the community) and a top-down (small group decides on the list of constructions) process.
* Work on specific constructions can already start before we have a list.
* List of constructions in WALS might be a starting point for a list of constructions, but probably not complete.
* Working groups that work out guidelines/descriptions of specific constructions should consider existing typological works.
* The goal of construction documentation should be the best solution, not the current state of the treebanks.
* Deviations from this ideal state should be documented in the language-specific documentation.
* BUT: When considering new analyses/analyses that differ from current annotation practices, consider "Ginter's razor". Complex changes should only be made when they substantially improve things.
* Constructions should have a holistic view on different annotation levels. They should not just be about dependency relations, but also discuss POS tags and morphology.

* List of some constructions that should be discussed (and person responsible for working out the documentation):
	* Some documentation already exists:
		* Coordination - ?
		* Ellipsis - ?
		* Multi-word expression - Kim Gerdes (should perhaps be harmonized with work from PARSEME cost action)
		* Comparative constructions - Dan Zeman
		* Parataxis - Sylvain Kahane
		* Punctuation - ?
	* No substantial documentation exists:
		* Expletives - Marie Candito
		* Clefts - Teresa Lynn
		* Causatives - Sylvain Kahane
		* Existentials - Fran Tyers
		* Partitives - ?
		* Complex predicates (maybe part of MWEs?) - ?
		* POS tags - Simonetta Montemagni
		* Names - Joakim Nivre
