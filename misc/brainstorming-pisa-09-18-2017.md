# UD Brainstorming Meeting
Pisa, September 18, 2017

## Discussion points

* Documentation
* Constructions
* Enhanced Dependencies
* Multi-word expressions
* Treebank naming / flags
* How to use the repositories?

# Documentation

(see also list of issues/ideas on this page)

* There is a consensus that the website should be organized around constructions. This should make it easier to find how a construction should be analyzed and should provide a more holistic view on analysis (E.g., passives in English are purely a dependency phenomenon, whereas passives in Swedish concern dependencies and morphological features)
* Majority of the discussion so far focused on how the website would be most useful for UD contributors. We should also consider other use cases and make sure the website also meets other users' needs.
* High priority should be given to developing a template to provide a short documentation of treebanks (much simpler than full language-specific documentation).
* Having a completely parallel language-specific documentation was too ambitious and is not really user-friendly.
* The search should allow synonyms for constructions (similar to the "redirected from" feature on Wikipedia).
* We need rules for the contribution process. Who can edit the universal guidelines? How should changes be approved? 
* The quality of treebanks varies a lot, which is not reflected. One idea is to have a rating system for the quality of a treebank ("stars?") and a badge system for adding documentation, similar to the badge system on Stackoverflow.
* Perhaps there should be wiki-style links from one construction to another, with special formatting if the page is missing.
* Sometimes examples on website contradict examples in treebanks. Often unclear which one of the two is correct.
* The search should be improved so that one can search for examples in the documentation.
* We should consider having tags for pages to make it easier to find constructions etc.
* First step should be to define the use cases and then go from there.
* Working group: Filip Ginter, Dan Zeman, Alexandre Rademaker, Teresa Lynn, Sylvain Kahane, Jenna Kanerva, Marie-Catherine de Marneffe, Sebastian Schuster
