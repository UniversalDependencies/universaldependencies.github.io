The subordinative suffix -_u_, in Neo-Assyrian mainly separable -(_ū_…)_ni_, is often also called subjunctive in Assyriological literature, although it is not mood and the same as Sub in UD. In Akkadian, the subordinative suffix is attached to a verbal predicate to indicate that a clause is subordinate to the main clause.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: subordinative
