### <a name="Subordinative">`Subordinative`</a>: subordinative

The subordinative suffix -_u_, in Neo-Assyrian mainly separable -(_ū_…)_ni_, is often also called subjunctive in Assyriological literature, although it is not mood and the same as Sub in UD. In Akkadian, the subordinative suffix is attached to a verbal predicate to indicate that a clause is subordinate to the main clause.

#### Examples
* _<b>ipparšidūni</b>_ “(as many as/which/who) had fled”
* _<b>usbakūni</b>_ “(While) I was (in …)”
* _<b>ša šumī šaṭra ipaššiṭu-ma šumšu išaṭṭaru</b>_ “Who erases my inscribed name and writes his (own) name”
