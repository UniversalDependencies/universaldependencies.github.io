The `xcomp` relation is used for clausal complements, but unlike [ccomp]() lack an explicit subject. The reference of the subject is determined by an argument external to the `xcomp` clause, which means that the clause inherits its subject from higher up in the tree. It is used in infinitive constructions with a predicative marker _kà_.

'I can do it'.

The infinitival construction can also express sequential or  purpose meaning, which semantically is not proper for core argument, but as a construction is the same, we decided to annotate it as `xcomp` as well.
