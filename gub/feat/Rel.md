`Rel` is a morpheme that combines with lexical roots and postpositions. They signalize the 
adjacency or contiguity (Rel=Cont) and non-adjacency or non-contiguity of head and depenent, 
e.g., possessor-noun, object-postposition.

### <a name="Cont">`Cont`</a>: contiguous

Contiguity is more often associated with the null morpheme or with "r".

#### Examples

* _<b>ywyok r-ehe</b>&nbsp;_ “on/against the wall”


### <a name="NCont">`NCont`</a>: non-contiguous

Non-contiguity is more often associated with the morphemes "i" and "h".

#### Examples

* _<b>i-hɨ</b>&nbsp;_ “He has a mother / there is his/her mother”

* _<b>h-emi-r-eko</b>&nbsp;_ “there is her/his/its/their wife”

### <a name="Abs">`Abs`</a>: absolute

Abslute relational indicates that the possessor is absent. It is associated with the morphemes "i" and "h".

#### Examples

* _<b>i-pira</b>&nbsp;_ “ (There is a) (someone's)  fish / ”

* _<b>h-emi-r-eko</b>&nbsp;_ “(There is a) (someone's) wife”



## Diffs

### Prague Dependency Treebank

The PDT tagset does not distinguish `Ptan` from `Plur` and `Coll` from `Sing`,
therefore this distinction is not being made in the converted data.
