<p><em>(Dan Zeman, Jenna Kanerva, Mojgan Seraji, Nizar Habash, Petya Osenova, Simonetta Montemagni, Teresa Lynn)</em></p>

<p>This topic is related to the Github issues
<a href="http://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/159">#159</a>,
<a href="http://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/157">#157</a>,
<a href="http://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/154">#154</a> and
<a href="http://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/132">#132</a>.</p>

<p>The issues discussed in this group are extremely complex and we could not hope for an ultimate
solution to be found within 90 minutes. We started collecting the input and we are going to go
on collecting it online. Then hopefully there will be more insight and we can find a way of
modifying the current guidelines.</p>

<h2 id="the-starting-point">The starting point</h2>

<p>There are languages that sort of lack the category of determiners. What we mean by that is
really just the category, not the words themselves. There are words that are very well
comparable to what is called determiners in other languages, they are just not called
determiners in the “traditional” grammar of the language. Instead, they are often called
pronouns.</p>

<p>In order to increase cross-lingual comparability, it is desirable to use the same labels for
these words across langauges. Consequently, we have to partially abandon the traditional
grammars and to define determiners in these languages. (Not necessarily in all languages. But
when we have words that are parallel to English or Romance determiners, we want parallel
analysis for them.)</p>

<p>The current borderline between <a href="">u-pos/PRON</a> and <a href="">u-pos/DET</a> in UD, simplified, says that
if it replaces a noun phrase, it is a pronoun; if it modifies a noun phrase, it is a
determiner. This definition dates back at least to the EAGLES multi-language annotation
project in the 1990s. The basic idea here is that pronouns share properties with nouns, and analogically,
determiners share properties with adjectives. Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>I saw <b>this</b> yesterday.</em> … <em>this</em> is <code>PRON</code></li>
  <li><em>I saw <b>this</b> car yesterday.</em> … <em>this</em> is <code>DET</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Thus the borderline is defined functionally.
It means that context matters: we classify these words according to how they are used rather
than what they are. One reason is that we cannot easily tell “what the words are”. The
existing taggers and tagsets are not going to help us because they do not distinguish
determiners. On the other hand, this functional approach contrasts with what we do elsewhere
in UD. For instance, we say that prepositions remain tagged <a href="">u-pos/ADP</a> even if they are
used as verbal particles (cf. English <em>come on</em>), which is a usage quite different from the
prototypical function of prepositions.</p>

<p>There is another and perhaps more important objection to the current definition: in languages
that traditionally do distinguish determiners, our definition does not precisely match the
borderline already established by their tagsets. Conforming to the UD guidelines thus means
that in these languages many words must be fixed too.</p>

<p>Finally, while the definition may seem robust at the first glance, its applicability is also
limited. A pronoun might be replacing a noun phrase but modifying another noun phrase at the
same time (as a genitive post-modifier). If a word does not modify a noun, it could mean that
it is a pronoun, but it could also be a determiner whose noun head has been elided. So the
definition does not cover all possible situations and we need either more freedom, or more
elaborate guidelines.</p>

<p>Example of ellipsis in [cs]:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em><b>Který</b> dort chceš?</em> “<b>Which</b> cake do you want?” … <em>který</em> is <code>DET</code></li>
  <li><em><b>Který</b> chceš?</em> “<b>Which</b> [one] do you want?” … <code>DET</code>, or <code>PRON</code>?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-the-options">What are the options?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Keep the functional definition, perhaps with a bit more freedom, such as:
“the language-specific documentation may further specify the conditions, e.g. by saying
that determiners do not occur as post-modifiers, that they must agree with the modified
nominal in gender, number and case and so on. It may also describe which situations are
analyzed as elliptical (i.e. the word is considered to be modifying an elided nominal and
thus it is tagged <code>DET</code> even though it is attached to something else).”</li>
  <li>Do not decide each individual usage of the word separately. Instead, look at prevailing
usage pattern in the corpus. This is still based on heuristics but it allows to
pre-categorize at least some of the words.
(But it is still possible to say that some words are homonymous and can belong to either
class.)</li>
  <li>Pre-categorization can be also based on other criteria.
In some languages, at least a subset of pronouns is clearly similar to adjectives
morphologically. For instance, they inflect for gender to be able to agree with the gender
of the nouns they modify. We could say that these are determiners, regardless whether they
are actually attached to a nominal in the sentence.
Along the same lines, there are pronouns that can never act like determiners. Personal
pronouns will probably fall here in most languages, at least their nominative forms.
And there will be a few more, such as <em>who</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the functional definition is the only one which might guarantee comparability and consistency across languages. However, if this option is selected there are other fuzzy distinctions - e.g. that between nouns and adjectives acting as nouns (as in <em>the old and the young</em>), or adjectives and verbs acting as adjectives (as in <em>written text</em> or <em>smiling person</em>) in specific constructions - which should be dealt with similarly: so, whatever decision is taken for dealing with the <code>det/pron</code> distinction, this might require a revision of the treatment of these other categories across the different languages.</p>

<h2 id="interaction-between-pos-tags-and-dependency-relations">Interaction between POS tags and dependency relations</h2>

<p>The current UD guidelines almost imply that the <a href="">u-pos/DET</a> POS tag and the <a href="">u-dep/det</a>
relation label occur at the same places. Functional multi-word expressions are an exception.
A determiner inside of a MWE will be attached to the previous token with the label
<a href="">u-dep/mwe</a>. If it happens to be the first token of the MWE, and the whole MWE behaves like
something else than a determiner, then it will also have a different label.</p>

<p>This gives us a good device to search for irregularities.
Even when we ignore MWEs, there are a number of points in the data where the <code>DET &lt;=&gt; det</code>
constraint is currently violated.</p>

<h3 id="when-det-does-not-imply-det">When <code>det</code> does not imply <code>DET</code></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Undecided/undecidable borderline between <code>DET</code> and <code>PRON</code>. The word is tagged <code>DET</code> but
attached as a pronoun (<code>nsubj</code>, <code>dobj</code>, <code>iobj</code>, <code>nmod</code>). An interesting example from the
English data is that <em>you</em> is tagged <code>PRON</code> but attached as <code>det</code> in <em>you guys</em>.
(But one could also argue that the whole thing is a MWE, in which <em>guys</em> acts as a new
plural suffix.)</li>
  <li>Fuzzy border between <code>DET</code> and <code>ADJ</code>.
[sv] <em>annan</em> “another”, <em>viss</em> “certain, some”, <em>många</em> “many”, <em>egen</em> “own”,
<em>hel</em> “whole” are <code>ADJ</code> + <code>det</code>.</li>
  <li>Multi-word determiners: [fr] <em>beaucoup de, moins de.</em></li>
  <li>Bad <a href="">u-pos/PROPN</a> tag in multi-word named entities. In examples like [es] <em><b>La</b>
Rioja,</em> [fr] <em><b>La</b> Crochais</em> the determiner is part of a named entity but it still
should be tagged <code>DET</code>, not <code>PROPN</code>.</li>
  <li>Other annotation or conversion errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no occurrences in bg, cs, da, fi-ftb. The other languages:</p>

  <li>Croatian: 631 PRON, 105 ADJ (83: sav = svůj = oneself’s), 101 ADV, 6 ADP, 6 AUX, 4 PART, 3 CONJ, 2 NOUN, 1 NUM.</li>
  <li>English: rare, but it exists: 14 PRON, 3 ADJ, 3 ADV, 2 NUM, 1 ADP.</li>
  <li>Finnish (Turku): 3128 PRON, 23 ADV, 5 ADJ, 5 NOUN, 1 SCONJ (?) Documentation diff: the current conversion of TDT does not use the DET tag.</li>
  <li>French: MWE beaucoup de, moins de; articles in multi-word named entities (La Crochais) are tagged PROPN! 226 PROPN, 105 ADP, 58 ADV, 11 X, 6 NOUN, 3 ADJ, 2 VERB, 1 PRON.</li>

  <li>Greek: 9463 ADJ, 356 PRON, 2 NUM. The Greek definite article is tagged as ADJ instead of DET (but documentation does not suggest that it is intentional).</li>
  <li>Hebrew: 520 ADV, 163 ADP, 115 PRON, 94 NUM, 33 CONJ, 6 ADJ, 2 NOUN, 2 X, 1 SCONJ.</li>
  <li>Hungarian: just 1 PRON :-)</li>
  <li>Indonesian: 332 PROPN, 252 PRON, 179 NOUN, 64 NUM, 14 PART, 3 ADV, 2 VERB, 1 ADJ, 1 PUNCT.</li>
  <li>Irish: 54 PRON, 25 X, 1 NOUN, 1 NUM, 1 PROPN. Sometimes pronoun under preposition: <em>leis siúd, leis sin, air sin</em> … are these errors?</li>
  <li>Italian: just 1 NUM, 1 PRON :-)</li>
  <li>Persian: 216 PRON, 212 ADV, 107 NOUN, 26 INTJ, 4 ADJ, 1 NUM.</li>
  <li>Spanish: 717 PROPN, 24 PRON, 20 X, 10 ADJ, 4 ADP, 3 SYM, 1 ADV, 1 CONJ, 1 PART, 1 VERB. Same problem with PROPN as in French.</li>
  <li>Swedish: 1345 ADJ, 594 NOUN, 44 ADV, 29 PRON, 3 PROPN, 2 ADP, 1 CONJ, 1 VERB.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="when-det-does-not-imply-det-1">When <code>DET</code> does not imply <code>det</code></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Quite a few cases actually do not count as an error because the dependency relation is a
subtype of <code>det</code>: <code>det:nummod</code>, <code>det:numgov</code>, <code>det:predet</code>, <code>det:def</code>, <code>det:poss</code>.</li>
  <li>Several languages analyze the relation between possessive determiners and the possessed
noun as <code>nmod:poss</code>, reportedly to make it parallel with other possessives (this
explanation appeared even in the universal guidelines, though several months after we
froze the guidelines). Maybe it is inherited from English where speakers do not feel such
a strong difference between genitive of a noun, and a possessive (adjective).
But much more than English this is visible in French, Spanish, Irish, Swedish and also
German, where it is quite obvious that possessive determiners (pronouns) are like
adjectives and should not be parallel to <code>nmod</code>.</li>
  <li>Negative determiners such as <em>no</em> in <em>no legal grounds</em> should be distinguished from the
verb-negating particles (English <em>not</em>). The <a href="">u-dep/neg</a> relation should be used for the
latter while the former should be <code>det</code>. But this is violated in English and French
(surprisingly not in Spanish, although otherwise these two datasets often share the same
decisions).</li>
  <li>Annotation or conversion errors.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>We are discussing how different languages encode “determination”.</p>

<p>More than one determiner per NP? There are currently no restrictions but grammars of some
languages assume at most one determiner per noun phrase. This is probably why we have
<code>det:predet</code> in English and Italian, to mark that the additional determiner is exceptional.</p>

<p>Pronouns, determiners and pronominal adverbs should always have a non-empty value of the
feature <a href="">u-feat/PronType</a>. In particular, articles should be tagged <code>PronType=Art</code>.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-table">The big table</h2>

<p>We thought it would be useful to get a broad picture of pronominal words in various languages,
how they behave and how they are usually classified in grammars of those languages.
It is a space of several dimensions and it is not clear what would be the best way of
visualizing it but let’s start with a table and see what we get.</p>

<p>Legend: <strong>TPOS</strong> = traditional part of speech, i.e. what category it belongs to in the
grammatical tradition used in this language. <strong>OPOS</strong> = part of speech coming from the
original / native tagset (but translated to universal POS tags, if possible);
this is likely, but not necessary, to be same as TPOS.
<strong>Similar</strong> = what non-pronominal part of speech (if any) does this word resemble?
For a concrete example, if the language has genders and the word takes different forms for
different genders in order to agree with a modified noun, it is probably like an adjective.
<strong>Amod</strong> = is it possible or even likely that it modifies a noun in a similar way to how
adjectives modify nouns?</p>

    <td>These words originated as combinations of the preposition <i>ta'</i> “of” and
        personal pronoun suffixes. Thus they literally correspond to “of me, of you” etc.
        Their only similarity to adjectives is that they are also placed after the
        noun they modify (the possessed noun), but this may be a pure coincidence.
        Unlike Maltese adjectives, the possessive pronouns do not agree with the possessed
        noun in gender.
        Besides these possessive pronouns, Maltese can also express possession by
        inflection of the possessed noun. That actually means that the personal pronoun
        suffixes are attached directly to the noun:
        <i>dar</i> “house”, <i>dari</i> “my house”, <i>darek</i> “your (Sing) house”,
        <i>daru</i> “his house”, <i>darha</i> “her house”, <i>darna</i> “our house”,
        <i>darkom</i> “your (Plur) house”, <i>darhom</i> “their house”.</td>
