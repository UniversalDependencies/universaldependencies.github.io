        <h2><code>clf</code>: classifier</h2>

<p>When a Thai noun is counted, that is, modified by a cardinal numeral, the numeral must be accompanied by a classifier.
Classifiers evolved from common nouns, some of them can still be used as common nouns and their UPOS tag is <a href="">NOUN</a>
regardless whether they act as classifiers or as regular nouns. Classifiers form a closed set and the numeral must be
accompanied by a classifier that matches the semantic class of the counted noun: for example, the classifier used when
counting animals will differ from the one used when counting books. Adding a classifier to a numeral can be compared
to gender inflection of congruent modifiers in other languages. UD treats the numeral with the classifier as one
syntactic unit that together modifies the counted noun. Therefore, the classifier is attached as a dependent of the
numeral, which in turn is attached to the main noun.</p>

<!-- Dne 29.07.2023 v 6:39 Siriluck Rattananiyomkul napsal(a): -->

<p>Some examples with classifiers (CLF). Thai words are replaced with English words for readability but the Thai word order is preserved. There is a <span style="color:red">NUM</span>, a <span style="color:green">DET</span> and a <span style="color:blue">relative clause</span> together with a CLF.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>book <span style="color:red">two</span> CLF <span style="color:green">this</span> <span style="color:blue">that I buy</span> stay on table</em> → The whole sentence means “these two books that I bought are on a table.” And the Thai words for “book” and “CLF” in this sentence are not the same word. <!-- Google: หนังสือสองเล่มนี้ที่ฉันซื้ออยู่บนโต๊ะ H̄nạngs̄ụ̄x s̄xng lèm nī̂ thī̀ c̄hạn sụ̄̂x xyū̀ bn tóa ; book = หนังสือ = H̄nạngs̄ụ̄x ; two = สอง = S̄xng ; book classifier = เล่ม = lèm ; this = นี้ = Nī̂ ; that I bought/buy = ที่ฉันซื้อ = Thī̀ c̄hạn sụ̄̂x ; are on a table = อยู่บนโต๊ะ = Xyū̀ bn tóa --></li>
</ul>

<p>From this sample, some words can be omitted:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>book CLF <span style="color:green">this</span> <span style="color:blue">that I buy</span> stay on table</em> → meaning “this book that I bought is on a table.” <!-- Google: หนังสือเล่มนี้ที่ฉันซื้ออยู่บนโต๊ะ H̄nạngs̄ụ̄x lèm nī̂ thī̀ c̄hạn sụ̄̂x xyū̀ bn tóa --></li>
  <li><em>book <span style="color:red">two</span> CLF <span style="color:blue">that I buy</span> stay on table</em> → meaning “two books that I bought are on a table.” <!-- Google: หนังสือสองเล่มที่ฉันซื้ออยู่บนโต๊ะ H̄nạngs̄ụ̄x s̄xng lèm thī̀ c̄hạn sụ̄̂x xyū̀ bn tóa --></li>
  <li><em>book CLF <span style="color:blue">that I buy</span> stay on table</em> → meaning “the book that I bought is on a table.” <!-- Google: หนังสือที่ฉันซื้ออยู่บนโต๊ะ H̄nạngs̄ụ̄x thī̀ c̄hạn sụ̄̂x xyū̀ bn tóa --></li>
  <li><em>book <span style="color:green">this</span> <span style="color:blue">that I buy</span> stay on table</em> → meaning “this book that I bought is on a table.” This structure (with no CLF) can be used, esp in speaking. However, some CLF cannot be omitted when it is used with some noun. <!-- Google: หนังสือเล่มนี้ที่ฉันซื้ออยู่บนโต๊ะ H̄nạngs̄ụ̄x lèm nī̂ thī̀ c̄hạn sụ̄̂x xyū̀ bn tóa --></li>
  <li><em>book <span style="color:blue">that I buy</span> stay on table</em> → meaning “a book that I bought is on a table.” <!-- Google: หนังสือที่ฉันซื้ออยู่บนโต๊ะ H̄nạngs̄ụ̄x thī̀ c̄hạn sụ̄̂x xyū̀ bn tóa --></li>
  <li><em>*book <span style="color:red">two</span> <span style="color:green">this</span> <span style="color:blue">that I buy</span> stay on table</em> → this is ungrammatical because no CLF is used when NUM is used. (However, in colloquial language on social networks, classifiers are sometimes omitted even when numerals are used.) <!-- This observation is mentioned in e-mail from Lek from 23.08.2023 16:24. --></li>
  <li><em>*book <span style="color:red">two</span> <span style="color:blue">that I buy</span> stay on table</em> → this is still ungrammatical because of no CLF.</li>
  <li><em>*book <span style="color:red">two</span> stay on table</em> → this is also ungrammatical because no words are modified by “two” in this context. (There are exceptional contexts in which <em>book two</em> would be acceptable and grammatical but we omit them here.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes 2 same classifiers can be used in the same sentence. For example,</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>book CLF1 big <span style="color:red">two</span> CLF2 <span style="color:green">this</span> <span style="color:blue">that I buy</span> stay on table</em> → meaning “these two big books that I bought are on a table.” The classifier CLF 1 is modified by “big”, and the CLF2 is modified by “two”, “this”, and “that I buy”. And the whole NP (two CLF2 this that I buy) modifies the NP (CLF1 big). And the whole NP (CLF1 big two CLF2 this that I buy) modifies “book” which is a head noun. <!-- Google: หนังสือเล่มใหญ่สองเล่มนี้ที่ฉันซื้ออยู่บนโต๊ะ H̄nạngs̄ụ̄x lèm h̄ıỵ̀ s̄xng lèm nī̂ thī̀ c̄hạn sụ̄̂x xyū̀ bn tóa --></li>
</ul>

<p>There are constructions where it is not obvious whether a noun should be considered a classifier. For example,</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>cat CLF1 big <span style="color:red">two</span> CLF2 this cute</em> → meaning “these two big cats are cute.” CLF1 and CLF2 are the same word with same spelling. They have the same POS which is NOUN, but we are not sure if CLF1 would be a classifier or not. Some native speakers prefer to see it as an ordinary noun. BTW, “cute” is this Thai sentence is a verb, not adjective. This sample is different from the sample above with 2 CLFs. But CLF2 must be a classifier because “two” is used with CLF2. Both CLF1 and CLF2 are nouns. <!-- Google: แมวตัวใหญ่สองตัวนี้น่ารัก Mæw tạw h̄ıỵ̀ s̄xng tạw nī̂ ǹā rạk --></li>
</ul>

<p>However, if “two CLF2 this” is omitted, CLF1 is a classifier.</p>

<p>In the sample above with 2 CLFs, “CLF1 big” could be seen as a noun phrase (if “big” is an adj) modifying “cat”. And the relation will not be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clf</code>. Plus, when we move “CLF1 big” and place it after “this”, it somehow changes the structure and POS, probably also meaning. Changing the order of a nominal with or without CLF in a sentence will change the meaning of the sentence slightly. It is like modifying different things, and UD annotations will be different too.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In Thai, a modifier is always placed after the modified noun, except quantity words and numbers expressing amount.</li>
  <li>This is why <a href="">NUM</a> modifies the classifier, not the head noun.
<!-- DZ: Why? I do not see how 2 follows from 1. If anything, then I see the opposite, because the numeral precedes the head noun and the classifier follows it, so the relation from the classifier to the numeral would be non-projective, which is possible but less usual. --></li>
  <li>Whenever a <a href="">NUM</a> is used to quantify a head noun (a numeral expressing amount, i.e., a cardinal numeral), a classifier is required; without the classifier, the sentence would be ungrammatical. The numeral is placed between the counted noun and the classifier: <em>student three CLF</em>. “A numeral expressing amount is always placed before the noun to be modified” — this statement (presumably taken from the Thai grammar) would entail that the numeral modifies the classifier and not the counted noun. But this would only hold if UD accepts this notion of “modification”. Since the numeral never occurs with the counted noun without the classifier, there are no other examples demonstrating that the numeral precedes its “modified noun”; therefore, it is still possible to say that the numeral modifies the preceding (counted) noun and the classifier depends on either the numeral or the counted noun. <!-- DZ: This is my reasoning. Lek insisted that the numeral modifies the classifier. --> The classifier is selected based on semantic qualities of the counted noun. For example, <em>student</em>, which is a human being, requires the classifier which is used for persons / human beings.</li>
  <li>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NUM</code> is not used, CLF is not required. We may or may not use it in the nominal. The reason to use or not use it is if we want to optionally emphasize the semantic qualities of the head noun. Plus, using CLF without NUM indicates some sense of definiteness.</li>
  <li>A Thai grammar book suggests that classifiers in Thai are used to classify both nouns and verbs. Their purpose is to mark focus. It is not clear whether the grammar book uses the term classifier for the same set of words that we would want here. The “classifiers” of verbs might actually be adverbs.</li>
  <li>When CLF is the same word (same spelling and meaning) as the head noun, and NUM is used also, the head noun can be deleted. For example,
    <ul>
      <li><em>finger two CLF</em> → (meaning “2 fingers”), and CLF in this NP is the same word as the head noun “finger”.</li>
      <li>When “finger” is omitted, as in “two CLF”, it is still grammatical and understandable.
The reason is that the head noun and CLF are the same word, and one of them can be omitted. Using both of them would be to emphasize what is discussed.</li>
      <li>However, from this, one may ask whether the remaining <em>finger</em> is still a classifier.
It could be simply the counted noun and we could say that in this case the classifier is omissible, and the numeral exceptionally occurs before the counted noun.</li>
      <li>But we cannot do the same transformation with e.g. <em>two book</em>. The Thai word “book” requires a classifier which is a different word with different spelling.
<!-- DZ: Let's use "CLFbook" to denote the classifier that is used with "book". Could you omit "book" and just say "two CLFbook"? --></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="noun--classifier--adjective">Noun + classifier + adjective</h2>

<!-- From Lek's yearly evaluation 28.06.2024 and the subsequent e-mails. -->

<p>While in the prototypical case classifiers are used with numerals and counted nouns, they can also occur between a noun and its modifying adjective, without any numeral. As classifiers developed from common nouns, one of the open questions is whether the word that looks like a classifier should be treated as a classifier in these constructions.</p>

<p>For example, <em>tua</em> can be a noun meaning “body” and it can be used as a classifier for animals. It cannot be a classifier for humans, although it can denote the human body as a common noun. With animals, it is ambiguous: It can literally refer to the animal’s body or it can be a classifier.</p>

<p>Google Translate of “a big dog”
หมาตัวใหญ่
H̄mā tạw h̄ıỵ̀
Lek: măa tua jàj
Gloss: dog body/CLF big
Můj translit: hmátúáhaiŷ¹</p>

<p>The classifier seems to be optional in this construction, although frequent enough that Google often uses it when translating from English to Thai.</p>

<p>สุนัขตัวใหญ่
S̄unạk̄h tạw h̄ıỵ̀
a big dog (Google’s preferred translation of “dog” is <em>sunakh</em>, although it recognizes <em>hma</em>, too)</p>

<p>Possible analyses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the classifier-like word is present, treat it as a common noun.</li>
  <li>If the classifier-like word is present, treat it as a classifier. It does not have its own modifiers (specifically, the adjective must modify directly the main noun and not the classifier). The classifier could be attached either to the main noun to its left, or to the adjective to its right. Being attached to the right may seem to violate the usual modification word order in Thai, but if this is a classifier (i.e., a function word), it is not a normal modification. We can compare it to the more prototypical construction of counted nouns, where the classifier depends on the numeral. However, in those constructions the word order is NOUN-NUM-CLF, so there the relation between the numeral and the classifier still goes left-to-right. Attachment to the main noun on the left would be relatively uncontroversial and it would signal that the classifier classifies the noun. Attachment to the adjective would signal that the classifier is present because of the adjective; and one could view the classifier-adjective constituent as an adjective agreeing with the noun it modifies (some languages have such agreement but they express it morphologically on the adjective).</li>

<p>In general, I observed (in Google Translate) the animal classifier <em>tạw</em> with the adjectives “big” and “small” but not with other adjectives. This does not mean that it is impossible with other adjectives but it indicates that it may be at least less preferred. If there is a determiner instead of the adjective, the classifier is present:</p>

<p>แมวตัวนี้
Mæw tạw nī̂
This cat</p>

<p>แมวตัวนั้น
Mæw tạw nận
that cat</p>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">mæw tạw nận \n cat CLF that
det(mæw, nận)
det(cat, that)
clf(nận, tạw)
clf(that, CLF)
</code></pre>

<p>If there is both a determiner and an adjective, the determiner occurs farther from the main noun and there are two instances of the classifier (although the first one may be treated as a common noun if it is what we do when there is the adjective without determiner).</p>

<p>แมวตัวใหญ่ตัวนั้น
Mæw tạw h̄ıỵ̀ tạw nận
that big cat</p>

<p>If both instances of <em>tạw</em> are analyzed as classifiers, we will probably end up with the following tree:</p>

<h3 id="non-clf-functions-of-mandarin-classifiers">Non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clf</code> functions of Mandarin classifiers</h3>

<p>In other constructions involving classifiers, they are annotated with other syntax relations. First, in Mandarin a classifier may also be considered to function as an indefinite determiner when a noun phrase consisting of a bare classifier accompanying a noun is in post-verbal position, as in (4).</p>

<pre><code class="language-conllu">1	切	_	VERB	_	_	0	root	_	cut
2	個	_	NOUN	_	_	3	det	_	CL:generic
3	梨子	_	NOUN	_	_	1	obj	_	pear

1	"cut	_	_	_	_	0	_	_	_
2	a	_	_	_	_	0	_	_	_
3	pear"	_	_	_	_	0	_	_	_

</code></pre>

<p>Second, if a noun phrase does not have a regular noun, then the classifier is promoted to head of the noun phrase and any numeral or determiner would depend on the classifier, such as in (5) and (6).</p>

<pre><code class="language-conllu">1	給	_	VERB	_	_	0	root	_	give
2	我	_	PRON	_	_	1	iobj	_	1SG

</code></pre>

<p>If there is a genitive 的 <em>de</em> between the classifier and the noun, then the classifier is also treated as a head noun for the numeral, and it is labeled as an <a href="">nmod</a> dependent of the noun.</p>

<pre><code class="language-conllu">1	我	_	PRON	_	_	2	nsubj	_	1SG

<p>Note that classifiers are tagged as <a href="">NOUN</a>. The feature <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NounType=Clf</code> is recommended for distinguishing classifiers from regular nouns.
