##SCONJ: subordinating conjunction

###Definition

A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause.

For coordinating conjunctions, see CCONJ.

##Examples

-complementizers, like αν ‘if’, άρα, αφού ‘since/therefore’, γιατί ‘why/because’, ενώ ‘while’, καθώς ‘as/while’, μήπως, ότι, πως ‘that’, ώστε ‘so as’, ώσπου ‘until’
-	adverbial clause introducers, like όταν ‘when’, αφότου ‘since’, or πριν ‘before’ (when introducing a clause not a nominal)
-	που:  it simply introduces a relative clause but it does not inflect, so it is distinguished from relative pronouns, which have a nominal function within the relative clause and area analysed as PRON.)
-	interrogative pronouns ποιος ‘who’, πόσος ‘how many/much’, τι ‘what kind of’ that introduce an indirect question that serves as an argument of a verb, e.g., ρώτησα ποιο/πόσο/τι θέλεις; (asked.1st which/how much/what want.2nd) ‘I asked which/how much/what do you want?’
