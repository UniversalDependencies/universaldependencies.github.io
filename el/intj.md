INTJ: interjection 
Definition
An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation. It typically expresses an emotional reaction, is not syntactically related to other accompanying expressions, and may include a combination of sounds not otherwise found in the language.
Note that words primarily belonging to another part of speech retains their original category when used in exclamations. For example, Παναγία μου! is a NOUN even in exclamatory uses.
As a special case of interjections, we recognize feedback particles such as yes, no, uhuh, etc. However, the Greek όχι ‘no’ should be tagged as PART, e.g. φέρε τον αναπτήρα, όχι τα σπίρτα ‘fetch the lighter, not the matches’.
