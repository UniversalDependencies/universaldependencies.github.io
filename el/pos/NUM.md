NUM: numeral
Definition
A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.
Cardinal numerals are always assigned the tag NUM whether they are used as determiners or not (as in Θύρα 7) and whether they are expressed as words (εφτά), digits (7) or Roman numerals (VΙΙ).
