PROPN: proper noun 

Definition
A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object.
When a PROPN is formed by an ADJ and a noun, such as Μεγάλη Βδομάδα ‘Holy Week’, Λιμενικό Σώμα ΄Coast Guard’, Άρειος Πάγος ‘The Supreme Court’  the adjective is tagged ADJ and the noun PROPN; the adjective modifies the noun via the amod relation.
When other phrases or sentences are used as names, the component words retain their original tags. For example, in Δίωξη ναρκωτικών ‘Drug Enforcement  Agency’, both Δίωξη and  ναρκωτικών are assigned the tag NOUN.
Acronyms of proper nouns, such as OHE ‘UN’ and NATO are tagged PROPN. Even if they contain numbers (as in various product names), they are tagged PROPN and not SYM: 130XE, DC10, DC-10. However, if the token consists entirely of digits (like 7 in Windows 7), it is tagged NUM.
