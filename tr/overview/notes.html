          <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>This is an unorganized collection of notes that should be
documented in proper sections later.</p>

<h2 id="some-special-constructions">Some special constructions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In some cases when noun phrases are coordinated with suffix <em>-lA</em>
it is not clear whether it is a conjunction or simply
‘commutative/instrumental’ case marking.</p>

    <p><code>
(1) Annem-le     babam     eve       gitmiş
    My_mother-lA my_father house.DAT go.PAST.EVID
    `My mother and my father went home.'
 or `My father went home with my mother.'
(2) Annem     babam-la     eve       gitmiş.
    My_mother my_father-lA house.DAT go.PAST.EVID
    `My mother went home with my mother.'
</code></p>

    <p>Coordination is only possible and more likely when the -lA suffix is
between the coordinated noun. Case-marking is possible in both
configurations (e.g., <em>Diş fırçam-la kardeşim lavaboyu temizlemiş</em>
‘apparently my sister/brother cleaned the sink with my toothbrush’).
In some cases it is difficult, or impossible without additional
context to disambiguate, <em>Ali-yle Ayşe evlendi</em> can mean ‘Ali and
Ayşe got married’ but also ‘Ayşe (but not Leyla) married Ali’.
In the first case the relation is <code>coord</code> (without a <code>cc</code>) and in
the second <code>nmod</code> modifying either the predicate or another noun
phrase. If the <em>-lA</em> phrase modifies the subject (and it is clearly
not a conjunction), we always attach it to the predicate. This
avoids <code>orphan</code> relations where subject is not expressed in the sentence (see below for other missing heads).</p>

    <p>Note that as in English PP attachment ambiguity, the <code>nmod</code> case can be ambiguous:</p>

    <p><code>
Ali Ahmet'i    teleskopla  gördü.
Ali Ahmet.ACC  telecope-lA see.
`Ali saw Ahmet with a telescope'.
</code>
With the right context, it is possible that the noun modified with 
the phrase with <em>-lA</em> is omitted in the sentence.</p>

    <p><code>
Dün       bir arkadaşı-yla   gördüm.
Yesterday a   friend.P3S-lA  see.PAST.1SG
`I saw (him/her) with a friend (of him/her)'.
</code>
In this case, we connect the phrase with <em>-lA</em> to the predicate with <code>orphan</code> relation.</p>

    <p>In case of coordination, if the second conjunct is a pronoun, it can
be omitted.</p>

    <p><code>
Annem-le      eve         gittik.
My mother-lA  house.DAT   go.PAST.1PL
'My mother and I went home'/'I went home with my mother'
</code>
<em>-lA</em> in these cases is almost always ambiguous between a case
marker and conjunction. If the second component is missing, and the context
does not clearly indicate a conjunction, we use <code>nmod</code>. Otherwise, we
use <code>orphan</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modal adverbs like <em>acaba</em> ‘I wonder’, <em>bakalım</em> ‘let’s see’,
<em>yoksa</em> ‘if not’ are linked to the main predicate using <code>discourse</code>
relation.</p>

    <p>The relation should also cover <em>yani</em>, <em>işte</em>, <em>şey</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pos-tagging-related">POS tagging related</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The time adverbs, <em>dün</em> ‘yesterday’, <em>bugün</em> ‘today’, <em>akşam</em> (in
the) evening, and so on are marked as nouns in MS treebank, and
corresponding words seem to be marked as nouns in English UD too.
This conflicts with words with similar usage, e.g., <em>şimdi</em> ‘now’.</p>

    <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Mark <em>dün/bugün/yarın</em> as <code>NOUN</code> but use the
relation label <code>nmod:tmod</code>. This should also cover nominal phrases
locative marking referring to time, e.g., <em>eve vardığımda</em> ‘when I
arrived home’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Turkish, a (rather large) number of postpositions are constructed
by a regular process, where a set of nouns (mostly indicating place
or some sort of abstract relation) are combined with possessive
and case (also with <em>-lA</em> and <em>-CA</em>) suffixes to form postpositions. For
example:
<code>
(1) Kitapların ara-sı-nda           bulabilirsin.
    Book.GEN   between.POS3SG.LOC   find.ABIL.AOR.P2SG
    `You can find (it/him/her) *between* the books.'
(2) Dolabın       arka-sı-na      düştü
    Cupboard.GEN  back-POS3SG.LOC fall.PAST
    `It fell *behind* the cupboard.'
</code></p>

    <p>Analyzing these as <code>ADP</code> seems reasonable, and would be parallel to
the analyses in English, and possibly in other languages. However,
things get a bit tricky, as the noun that is modified by the
postposition may disappear. As in,
<code>
(3) (Bizim) ön-ümüz-den       gidiyor.
    We.GEN  front.POS1PL.ABL  go.PAST.PROG
    `he/she/it is going *in front of* us'
(4) (Senin) yer-in-e          onu     atamışlar.
    You.GEN place-POS2SG.DAT  he.DAT  appoint.EVID.P3PL
    `they appointed him *instead of* you.
</code>
Note that the information about the (pro)noun being modified is
recoverable from the postposition (using the possessive agreement 
marker) but the noun phrase is missing.</p>

    <p>Alternatives are (1) treating these as regular nouns (METU-Sabancı
does so),  (2) marking them as the head of the phrase when the noun
phrase is missing, and (3) make sure the case marker introduces a
new IG, and mark the noun component of the postposition as the 
head of the postpositional phrase. This is somewhat similar to 
the noun phrase analysis).</p>

    <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> (tentative) follow METU-Sabancı analysis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UD does not seem to have a clear way of marking onomatopoeia.
In most cases <code>X</code> seems to be a good option.</p>

    <p>In Turkish, onomatopoeic words may get some suffixes. Most common
case is the <em>-lA</em> suffix which derives a noun meaning making a sound
like it, e.g., <em>kedi miyav-la-r</em> ‘cat meows’.</p>

    <p>In a rather infrequent usage, these words may also get copular
suffixes (An example from the web: <em>Gitsin çay falan demlesin, ne o
öyle yok havmış da yok miyavmış da bilmemneymiş.</em>. This also affects
the analysis of foreign phrases, e.g., <em>Bunun İngilizce orjinali ‘to
be or not to be’dir</em> ‘Original English (version) of this is “to be
or not to be” (quoting the foreign expressions is common, but not
necessarily a standard practice).</p>

    <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> <code>X</code>, for the case of verb derivation, we don not
need to keep the derivation history, so derived verbs will show up as verbs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A particular class of complex “pronominals” are formed by possessive
suffixes attached to adjectives, determiners and numerals. For
example, <em>üç-ü</em> ‘three of them’, <em>sarı-ları</em> ‘the yellow parts (of
it)’/’the ones that are yellow’, <em>hiçbir-imiz</em> ‘none of us’. These
words behave a lot like a normal pronouns. METU-Sabancı treebank
marks these as adjectives that are promoted to nouns, followed by a
possessive suffix. TRmorph analyzes as dervied pronouns.</p>

    <p>Marking them as pronouns may be interesting as their referrents may
potentially be resolved in the linguistic context. On the other hand
this seems to be against the current UD classification that lists
pronouns as closed class words. (On a related note, one can stretch
this to verbal nouns too, e.g., <em>Bu hafta bir sürü kısa öykü yazdım. 
Daha sonradan yaztıklarım daha guzel oldu.</em> 
‘I wrote many short stories today. The ones I wrote later were better’.)</p>

    <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> (tentative) Follow METU-Sabancı analysis, unless the
resulting pronoun is a lexicalized one.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>With the same set of TAM markers, tense/aspect/modality changes 
in subordinated predicates.</p>

    <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> keep the features as they are predicted for the
predicates of the non-subordinate clauses (it likely that these
could be adjusted automatically).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes-on-annotation-of-specific-words">Notes on annotation of specific words</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>eğer</em> an <em>şayet</em> signal a conditional clause, but they are
redundant since they always coexist with the compulsoray mood
marker on conditional clauses. We mark them as <code>SCONJ</code> (following
TRmorph), but attach to the head of the conditional clause using the
<code>discourse</code> relation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The words <em>var</em> ‘(something) exists’ and <em>yok</em> ‘(something) does not exist’ 
are used for formimg “existential sentences”. In this function, these words
behave like nominal predicates. Although they do not function like
adjectives in general, METU-Sabancı marks them as adjectives.</p>

    <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Follow METU-Sabancı analysis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another special word is negative particle ‘değil’. It mainly allows
negating the nominal predicates. In this function, it behaves
similar to copular verbs (<em>ol-</em>, <em>bulun-</em>). METU-Sabancı marks it as
a verb, and uses a special relation <code>NEGATIVE.PARTICLE</code>.</p>

    <p>If değil is used as a predicate, we treat it similar to <em>ol-</em>, it is
marked as <code>VERB</code> with feature assignment <code>Negative=neg</code>. If it is used 
in a copular construction, we use the relation <code>cop</code> to connect it to 
the nominal predicate. 
~~~~ sdparse
Arabam mavi değil .\n My car is not blue .
cop(mavi, değil)
~~~~</p>

    <p><em>değil</em> can also be used with verbal predicates, acting as an
auxiliary, in this case we relate it to the main verb with relating
<code>aux</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Öldürecek değiller . \n They are not going to kill (someone) .
aux(öldürecek, değiller)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>If *değil* is used to negate a non-predicate, we mark it as `PART`
(again with feature `Negative=neg`), and attach it to the content
word with relation `neg`. (???)
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>olarak</em> (copula <em>ol-</em> + suffix <em>-ArAk</em>) is somewhat different than 
other uses of the copula. It forms adverbial phrases.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clitic <em>dA</em> (<em>de/da</em>)</p>

    <p>In its common use, <em>dA</em> is a discourse connective. In this case, 
we mark it as <code>ADV</code> and attach it to the word/phrase that it modifies 
(typically the preceding word), and mark as <code>advmod:emph</code>, which 
seems to be used in Czech.</p>

    <p>When <em>dA</em> is attached to a subordinate predicate, it may look like a
subordinating conjunction, <em>Okuyup da anla(ma)mış</em> ‘she
did (not) understand (because/although) she read (it)’. Note that in
this usage, the suffix <em>-(y)Ip</em> functions as the subordinator.
Hence, we mark <em>dA</em> as above.</p>

    <p><em>dA</em> also functions as a coordinating conjunction. If it is used in
a construction like <em>Ahmet de Ali de aradı</em> ‘Ahmet and Ali both
called’, we still attach the clitic to the preceding word, but mark
coordination without a conjunction, in this case the POS tag is
<code>CCONJ</code>.</p>

    <p>If it is used with the meaning of ‘but’, e.g., <em>içerim de,
arabayı kim kullanacak?</em> ‘I would/can drink, but (then) who will
drive?’. In this case, it is connected to head of the conjunction
with relation <code>cc</code>.</p>

    <p>A infrequent, but interesting usage of <em>dA</em> is with
compound verb forms including suffix <em>-abil</em>. A word/utterance like
<em>ara-yabilirim de</em> ‘I may also call’ can alternatively be expressed
like <em>araya da bilirim</em>. Note that the first word include part of
the suffix ‘-(y)Abil’, and while the last word contains related free
morpheme <em>bil-</em> ‘to know’ the expression has nothing to do with the verb
<em>bil-</em>. In this case, we analyze second part of the verb as an
auxiliary, and attach <em>dA</em> to the first part.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">araya da bilirim \n I could call too.
advmod:emph(araya, da)
aux(araya, bilirim)
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Clitic <em>ki</em></p>

    <p>Either subordinating conjunction or a discourse connective (mark
  with <code>advmod:emph</code> or <code>discourse</code>). (<strong>expand this</strong>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>-(y)sA</em> and <em>ise</em></p>

    <p>The suffix <em>-(y)sA</em> or its clictic form <em>ise</em> behave like the
  copular suffixes or clitics. It mianly forms conditional clauses.
  <em>Kitabın tamamını okudu<b>ysa</b> şaşarım</em> ‘I’d be surprised if she read all of the book’. We treat this case as subordination, mark the relation with <code>advmod:cond</code>.
~~~~ sdparse
Kitabın tamamını okuduysa şaşarım .
advcl:cond(şaşarım, okuduysa)
~~~~</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Evde yse yemek yapmıştır . \n He'd have cooked if he is at home.
advcl:cond(yapmıştır, evde)
cop(evde, yse)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>When attached to nouns, both forms can also be used as a discouse
connective with the meaning 'as for NOUN'. In this case (following
English UD), we mark the copular suffix/clitic with `case` and use
appropriate relation (likely `nmod`) to relate it to the head.
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sdparse">Arabam sa henüz satılmadı . \ As for my car, it wasn't sold yet.
case(arabam, sa)
nsubjpass(satılmadı, arabam)
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>hani</em> is a word that forms (mostly rhetorical) ‘where’ questions.
G&amp;K define it as an interjection. In most cases, there is no other word 
that indicate that the sentence is a question. Furthermore, it fills
in a (pro)noun slot in this usage. In this case, we mark it as 
<code>PRON</code> (with <code>PronType=Int</code>). In some cases it co-occurs with
<em>nerede</em> ‘where’. In that case, it is loosely connected to the
sentence structure, so, we mark it as <code>ADV</code> and connect to the
predicate with relation <code>discourse</code>. It may also occur without
<em>nerede</em> but with a weak connection to the sentence structure.
We also mark it as a discourse connective in this usage. (???)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reflexive pronoun (<em>kendi</em> and its other forms) is normally
complementary to the reflexive verbs. If a verb is reflexive, there
normally ‘kendi’ is not needed. However, in some cases it is used,
likely for emphasis. In these cases, we mark it as if it is the
object of the reflexive ….</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="derivations">Derivations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>-lA</strong> is a productive suffix that derives verbs from nouns
and onomatopoeia, e.g., <em>model</em> ‘model-N’, <em>modelle</em> ‘model-V’.
It does not seem to be possible for the derived noun to have any
dependents, the whole word acts as a single unit.</p>

    <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> collapse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>-lAn</strong> is a another productive suffix that derives verbs:
<em>hoş-lan</em>, <em>silah-lan</em>, <em>ağaç-lan</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> collapse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>-lIk</strong> nominals from nominals. Besides lexicalized forms <em>tuz-luk</em>
‘salt container/shaker’, it is also quite productive. The nominal
modified by <em>-lIk</em> may be modified by other words in rare cases,
e.g., <em>üç (büyük) araç-lık park yeri</em> ‘parking spot for three big vehicles’.</p>

    <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> split. We keep the first IG as the head, and mark it
with relation <code>case</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>-CI</strong> derives nouns from nouns, typically it derives “occupation
nouns”, e.g. <em>şarap-çı</em> ‘the wine maker/seller’ but also someone who
has a taste/preference for something, so the example could also mean
‘person who prefers wine (over beer)’. Although not very frequent,
the non-derived noun can be modified by other words: 
<em>[kırmızı şarap]-çı</em> ‘person preferring red wine (over white wine)’/’red wine seller’.
Similarly, <em>iki [[yağlı güreş]-çi]</em> ‘lit: two [[oil(y) wrestle]-r]’
(the sport is called ‘oil(y) wrestling’ not that the wrestlers are
oily (at least not always). Cf. <em>[iki [güçlü [güreş-çi]]]</em> ‘two
strong wrestlers’.</p>

    <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> split, and mark the final IG as the head of the
phrase. We currently use <code>nmod</code> between two IGs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>-DIr</strong> attached to time expressions create time adverbials with
the approximate meaning of ‘since’ or ‘for’, as in <em>asır-dır</em>
‘for/since centuries’, <em>üç haftadır</em> ‘for three weeks’, 
<em>uzun yıllar-dır</em> ‘for many years’. In the last two examples the number
and the adjective modifies the noun, not the resulting adverbial.</p>

    <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> split. We keep the first IG as head, and relate them
with <code>case</code>, this is somewhat in line with the English UD where 
‘since/for’ would be linked with <code>case</code> as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>-lArI</strong> attaches to time expressions, indicating repeating events,
<em>hafta sonları kitap okurum</em>
‘I read books <em>in the weekends</em>’,
<em>kış geceleri çok üşürdü</em> 
‘(s)he used to be/feel very cold <em>in the winter nights</em>’.
The construction is ambiguous between noun-phrase and time adverb.
That is, <em>geceleri araştıyorum</em> could mean ‘I research (something)
at nights’ or ‘I research <em>nights</em>/I do research about nights’. 
TRmorph has a special (derivational) tag for this construction.</p>

    <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> analyze these as normal noun (phrase) but mark with
<code>nmod:tmod</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>-CA</strong> is a multi-functional derivational suffix. When attached to
nouns, it forms adverbial phrases: <em>[güvenlik kuvvetleri]-nce</em> ‘by the
security forces’. In this usage, <em>-CA</em> may scope over the whole
phrase headed by the noun it is attached to. In this usage we split
-CA, and connect to the noun with <code>case</code> relation (the noun bing the
head).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
